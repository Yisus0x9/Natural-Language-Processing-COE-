10.48550/arXiv.2509.19274v1	DRISHTIKON: A Multimodal Multilingual Benchmark for Testing Language   Models' Understanding on Indian Culture	Arijit Maji; Raghvendra Kumar; Akash Ghosh; Anushka; Nemil Shah; Abhilekh Borah; Vanshika Shah; Nishant Mishra; Sriparna Saha	We introduce DRISHTIKON, a first-of-its-kind multimodal and multilingual benchmark centered exclusively on Indian culture, designed to evaluate the cultural understanding of generative AI systems. Unlike existing benchmarks with a generic or global scope, DRISHTIKON offers deep, fine-grained coverage across India's diverse regions, spanning 15 languages, covering all states and union territories, and incorporating over 64,000 aligned text-image pairs. The dataset captures rich cultural themes including festivals, attire, cuisines, art forms, and historical heritage amongst many more. We evaluate a wide range of vision-language models (VLMs), including open-source small and large models, proprietary systems, reasoning-specialized VLMs, and Indic-focused models, across zero-shot and chain-of-thought settings. Our results expose key limitations in current models' ability to reason over culturally grounded, multimodal inputs, particularly for low-resource languages and less-documented traditions. DRISHTIKON fills a vital gap in inclusive AI research, offering a robust testbed to advance culturally aware, multimodally competent language technologies.	cs.CL; cs.MM	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.19271v1	WolBanking77: Wolof Banking Speech Intent Classification Dataset	Abdou Karim Kandji; Frédéric Precioso; Cheikh Ba; Samba Ndiaye; Augustin Ndione	Intent classification models have made a lot of progress in recent years. However, previous studies primarily focus on high-resource languages datasets, which results in a gap for low-resource languages and for regions with a high rate of illiterate people where languages are more spoken than read or written. This is the case in Senegal, for example, where Wolof is spoken by around 90\% of the population, with an illiteracy rate of 42\% for the country. Wolof is actually spoken by more than 10 million people in West African region. To tackle such limitations, we release a Wolof Intent Classification Dataset (WolBanking77), for academic research in intent classification. WolBanking77 currently contains 9,791 text sentences in the banking domain and more than 4 hours of spoken sentences. Experiments on various baselines are conducted in this work, including text and voice state-of-the-art models. The results are very promising on this current dataset. This paper also provides detailed analyses of the contents of the data. We report baseline f1-score and word error rate metrics respectively on NLP and ASR models trained on WolBanking77 dataset and also comparisons between models. We plan to share and conduct dataset maintenance, updates and to release open-source code.	cs.CL; cs.AI; cs.LG	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.19270v1	SloPalSpeech: A 2,8000-Hour Slovak Speech Corpus from Parliamentary Data	Erik Božík; Marek Šuppa	Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for low-resource languages like Slovak is hindered by the scarcity of training data. To address this, we introduce SloPalSpeech, a new, large-scale Slovak ASR dataset containing 2,806 hours of speech from parliamentary proceedings. We developed a robust processing pipeline to align and segment long-form recordings into clean, 30-second audio-transcript pairs suitable for model training. We use this dataset to fine-tune several OpenAI Whisper models (small, medium, large-v3, and large-v3-turbo), achieving significant Word Error Rate (WER) reductions on standard Slovak benchmarks like Common Voice and FLEURS. For instance, the fine-tuned Whisper-small model's WER dropped by up to 70\%, approaching the baseline performance of the much larger Whisper-large-v3 model. To foster future research in low-resource speech recognition, we publicly release the complete SloPalSpeech dataset, the fully segmented transcripts (60 million words), and all our fine-tuned models.	cs.CL; cs.AI; cs.SD	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.19269v1	Extracting Conceptual Spaces from LLMs Using Prototype Embeddings	Nitesh Kumar; Usashi Chatterjee; Steven Schockaert	Conceptual spaces represent entities and concepts using cognitively meaningful dimensions, typically referring to perceptual features. Such representations are widely used in cognitive science and have the potential to serve as a cornerstone for explainable AI. Unfortunately, they have proven notoriously difficult to learn, although recent LLMs appear to capture the required perceptual features to a remarkable extent. Nonetheless, practical methods for extracting the corresponding conceptual spaces are currently still lacking. While various methods exist for extracting embeddings from LLMs, extracting conceptual spaces also requires us to encode the underlying features. In this paper, we propose a strategy in which features (e.g. sweetness) are encoded by embedding the description of a corresponding prototype (e.g. a very sweet food). To improve this strategy, we fine-tune the LLM to align the prototype embeddings with the corresponding conceptual space dimensions. Our empirical analysis finds this approach to be highly effective.	cs.CL	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.19265v1	Cross-Cultural Transfer of Commonsense Reasoning in LLMs: Evidence from   the Arab World	Saeed Almheiri; Rania Hossam; Mena Attia; Chenxi Wang; Preslav Nakov; Timothy Baldwin; Fajri Koto	Large language models (LLMs) often reflect Western-centric biases, limiting their effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts. Although some work has explored cultural alignment, the potential for cross-cultural transfer, using alignment in one culture to improve performance in others, remains underexplored. This paper investigates cross-cultural transfer of commonsense reasoning in the Arab world, where linguistic and historical similarities coexist with local cultural differences. Using a culturally grounded commonsense reasoning dataset covering 13 Arab countries, we evaluate lightweight alignment methods such as in-context learning and demonstration-based reinforcement (DITTO), alongside baselines like supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Our results show that merely 12 culture-specific examples from one country can improve performance in others by 10\% on average, within multilingual models. In addition, we demonstrate that out-of-culture demonstrations from Indonesia and US contexts can match or surpass in-culture alignment for MCQ reasoning, highlighting cultural commonsense transferability beyond the Arab world. These findings demonstrate that efficient cross-cultural alignment is possible and offer a promising approach to adapt LLMs to low-resource cultural settings.	cs.AI; cs.CL	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.19249v1	Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training Data	Siheng Li; Kejiao Li; Zenan Xu; Guanhua Huang; Evander Yang; Kun Li; Haoyuan Wu; Jiajia Wu; Zihao Zheng; Chenchen Zhang; Kun Shi; Kyrierl Deng; Qi Yi; Ruibin Xiong; Tingqiang Xu; Yuhao Jiang; Jianfeng Yan; Yuyuan Zeng; Guanghui Xu; Jinbao Xue; Zhijiang Xu; Zheng Fang; Shuai Li; Qibin Liu; Xiaoxue Li; Zhuoyu Li; Yangyu Tao; Fei Gao; Cheng Jiang; Bo Chao Wang; Kai Liu; Jianchen Zhu; Wai Lam; Wayyt Wang; Bo Zhou; Di Wang	The growing disparity between the exponential scaling of computational resources and the finite growth of high-quality text data now constrains conventional scaling approaches for large language models (LLMs). To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data (RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast to prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning, RLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to learn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement learning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) rely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this dependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data. Specifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the policy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the preceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training data, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader contexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive experiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across multiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied to Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$, $6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and AIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling behavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In addition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries of LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance.	cs.CL; cs.AI; cs.LG	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.19231v1	Finding My Voice: Generative Reconstruction of Disordered Speech for   Automated Clinical Evaluation	Karen Rosero; Eunjung Yeo; David R. Mortensen; Cortney Van't Slot; Rami R. Hallac; Carlos Busso	We present ChiReSSD, a speech reconstruction framework that preserves children speaker's identity while suppressing mispronunciations. Unlike prior approaches trained on healthy adult speech, ChiReSSD adapts to the voices of children with speech sound disorders (SSD), with particular emphasis on pitch and prosody. We evaluate our method on the STAR dataset and report substantial improvements in lexical accuracy and speaker identity preservation. Furthermore, we automatically predict the phonetic content in the original and reconstructed pairs, where the proportion of corrected consonants is comparable to the percentage of correct consonants (PCC), a clinical speech assessment metric. Our experiments show Pearson correlation of 0.63 between automatic and human expert annotations, highlighting the potential to reduce the manual transcription burden. In addition, experiments on the TORGO dataset demonstrate effective generalization for reconstructing adult dysarthric speech. Our results indicate that disentangled, style-based TTS reconstruction can provide identity-preserving speech across diverse clinical populations.	cs.SD; cs.AI; cs.CL	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.19228v1	CompLLM: Compression for Long Context Q&A	Gabriele Berton; Jayakrishnan Unnikrishnan; Son Tran; Mubarak Shah	Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational challenges when processing long contexts due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. While soft context compression methods, which map input text to smaller latent representations, have shown promise, their real-world adoption is limited. Existing techniques typically compress the context as a single unit, which leads to quadratic compression complexity and an inability to reuse computations across queries with overlapping contexts. In this work, we introduce CompLLM, a soft compression technique designed for practical deployment. Instead of processing the context holistically, CompLLM divides it into segments and compresses each one independently. This simple design choice yields three critical properties: efficiency, as the compression step scales linearly with the context length; scalability, enabling models trained on short sequences (e.g., 1k tokens) to generalize to contexts of 100k tokens; and reusability, allowing compressed segments to be cached and reused across different queries. Our experiments show that with a 2x compression rate, at high context lengths CompLLM speeds up Time To First Token (TTFT) by up to 4x and reduces the KV cache size by 50%. Furthermore, CompLLM achieves performance comparable to that obtained with the uncompressed context, and even surpasses it on very long sequences, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical utility.	cs.CL	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.19224v1	Systematic Comparative Analysis of Large Pretrained Language Models on   Contextualized Medication Event Extraction	Tariq Abdul-Quddoos; Xishuang Dong; Lijun Qian	Attention-based models have become the leading approach in modeling medical language for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in clinical notes. These models outperform traditional techniques by effectively capturing contextual rep- resentations of language. In this research a comparative analysis is done amongst pre- trained attention based models namely Bert Base, BioBert, two variations of Bio+Clinical Bert, RoBerta, and Clinical Long- former on task related to Electronic Health Record (EHR) information extraction. The tasks from Track 1 of Harvard Medical School's 2022 National Clinical NLP Challenges (n2c2) are considered for this comparison, with the Contextualized Medication Event Dataset (CMED) given for these task. CMED is a dataset of unstructured EHRs and annotated notes that contain task relevant information about the EHRs. The goal of the challenge is to develop effective solutions for extracting contextual information related to patient medication events from EHRs using data driven methods. Each pre-trained model is fine-tuned and applied on CMED to perform medication extraction, medical event detection, and multi-dimensional medication event context classification. Pro- cessing methods are also detailed for breaking down EHRs for compatibility with the applied models. Performance analysis has been carried out using a script based on constructing medical terms from the evaluation portion of CMED with metrics including recall, precision, and F1-Score. The results demonstrate that models pre-trained on clinical data are more effective in detecting medication and medication events, but Bert Base, pre- trained on general domain data showed to be the most effective for classifying the context of events related to medications.	cs.CL; cs.AI	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.19212v1	Steering Multimodal Large Language Models Decoding for Context-Aware   Safety	Zheyuan Liu; Zhangchen Xu; Guangyao Dou; Xiangchi Yuan; Zhaoxuan Tan; Radha Poovendran; Meng Jiang	Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, yet their ability to make context-aware safety decisions remains limited. Existing methods often fail to balance oversensitivity (unjustified refusals of benign queries) and undersensitivity (missed detection of visually grounded risks), leaving a persistent gap in safety alignment. To address this issue, we introduce Safety-aware Contrastive Decoding (SafeCoDe), a lightweight and model-agnostic decoding framework that dynamically adjusts token generation based on multimodal context. SafeCoDe operates in two stages: (1) a contrastive decoding mechanism that highlights tokens sensitive to visual context by contrasting real and Gaussian-noised images, and (2) a global-aware token modulation strategy that integrates scene-level reasoning with token-level adjustment to adapt refusals according to the predicted safety verdict. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM architectures and safety benchmarks, covering undersensitivity, oversensitivity, and general safety evaluations, show that SafeCoDe consistently improves context-sensitive refusal behaviors while preserving model helpfulness.	cs.CL; cs.AI	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.19300v1	CAR-Flow: Condition-Aware Reparameterization Aligns Source and Target   for Better Flow Matching	Chen Chen; Pengsheng Guo; Liangchen Song; Jiasen Lu; Rui Qian; Xinze Wang; Tsu-Jui Fu; Wei Liu; Yinfei Yang; Alex Schwing	Conditional generative modeling aims to learn a conditional data distribution from samples containing data-condition pairs. For this, diffusion and flow-based methods have attained compelling results. These methods use a learned (flow) model to transport an initial standard Gaussian noise that ignores the condition to the conditional data distribution. The model is hence required to learn both mass transport and conditional injection. To ease the demand on the model, we propose Condition-Aware Reparameterization for Flow Matching (CAR-Flow) -- a lightweight, learned shift that conditions the source, the target, or both distributions. By relocating these distributions, CAR-Flow shortens the probability path the model must learn, leading to faster training in practice. On low-dimensional synthetic data, we visualize and quantify the effects of CAR. On higher-dimensional natural image data (ImageNet-256), equipping SiT-XL/2 with CAR-Flow reduces FID from 2.07 to 1.68, while introducing less than 0.6% additional parameters.	cs.CV	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.19297v1	VolSplat: Rethinking Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting with   Voxel-Aligned Prediction	Weijie Wang; Yeqing Chen; Zeyu Zhang; Hengyu Liu; Haoxiao Wang; Zhiyuan Feng; Wenkang Qin; Zheng Zhu; Donny Y. Chen; Bohan Zhuang	Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a highly effective solution for novel view synthesis. Existing methods predominantly rely on a pixel-aligned Gaussian prediction paradigm, where each 2D pixel is mapped to a 3D Gaussian. We rethink this widely adopted formulation and identify several inherent limitations: it renders the reconstructed 3D models heavily dependent on the number of input views, leads to view-biased density distributions, and introduces alignment errors, particularly when source views contain occlusions or low texture. To address these challenges, we introduce VolSplat, a new multi-view feed-forward paradigm that replaces pixel alignment with voxel-aligned Gaussians. By directly predicting Gaussians from a predicted 3D voxel grid, it overcomes pixel alignment's reliance on error-prone 2D feature matching, ensuring robust multi-view consistency. Furthermore, it enables adaptive control over Gaussian density based on 3D scene complexity, yielding more faithful Gaussian point clouds, improved geometric consistency, and enhanced novel-view rendering quality. Experiments on widely used benchmarks including RealEstate10K and ScanNet demonstrate that VolSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing more plausible and view-consistent Gaussian reconstructions. In addition to superior results, our approach establishes a more scalable framework for feed-forward 3D reconstruction with denser and more robust representations, paving the way for further research in wider communities. The video results, code and trained models are available on our project page: https://lhmd.top/volsplat.	cs.CV	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.19296v1	Lyra: Generative 3D Scene Reconstruction via Video Diffusion Model   Self-Distillation	Sherwin Bahmani; Tianchang Shen; Jiawei Ren; Jiahui Huang; Yifeng Jiang; Haithem Turki; Andrea Tagliasacchi; David B. Lindell; Zan Gojcic; Sanja Fidler; Huan Ling; Jun Gao; Xuanchi Ren	The ability to generate virtual environments is crucial for applications ranging from gaming to physical AI domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and industrial AI. Current learning-based 3D reconstruction methods rely on the availability of captured real-world multi-view data, which is not always readily available. Recent advancements in video diffusion models have shown remarkable imagination capabilities, yet their 2D nature limits the applications to simulation where a robot needs to navigate and interact with the environment. In this paper, we propose a self-distillation framework that aims to distill the implicit 3D knowledge in the video diffusion models into an explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, eliminating the need for multi-view training data. Specifically, we augment the typical RGB decoder with a 3DGS decoder, which is supervised by the output of the RGB decoder. In this approach, the 3DGS decoder can be purely trained with synthetic data generated by video diffusion models. At inference time, our model can synthesize 3D scenes from either a text prompt or a single image for real-time rendering. Our framework further extends to dynamic 3D scene generation from a monocular input video. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in static and dynamic 3D scene generation.	cs.CV; cs.GR	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.19282v1	OverLayBench: A Benchmark for Layout-to-Image Generation with Dense   Overlaps	Bingnan Li; Chen-Yu Wang; Haiyang Xu; Xiang Zhang; Ethan Armand; Divyansh Srivastava; Xiaojun Shan; Zeyuan Chen; Jianwen Xie; Zhuowen Tu	Despite steady progress in layout-to-image generation, current methods still struggle with layouts containing significant overlap between bounding boxes. We identify two primary challenges: (1) large overlapping regions and (2) overlapping instances with minimal semantic distinction. Through both qualitative examples and quantitative analysis, we demonstrate how these factors degrade generation quality. To systematically assess this issue, we introduce OverLayScore, a novel metric that quantifies the complexity of overlapping bounding boxes. Our analysis reveals that existing benchmarks are biased toward simpler cases with low OverLayScore values, limiting their effectiveness in evaluating model performance under more challenging conditions. To bridge this gap, we present OverLayBench, a new benchmark featuring high-quality annotations and a balanced distribution across different levels of OverLayScore. As an initial step toward improving performance on complex overlaps, we also propose CreatiLayout-AM, a model fine-tuned on a curated amodal mask dataset. Together, our contributions lay the groundwork for more robust layout-to-image generation under realistic and challenging scenarios.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.19277v1	MOIS-SAM2: Exemplar-based Segment Anything Model 2 for multilesion   interactive segmentation of neurobromas in whole-body MRI	Georgii Kolokolnikov; Marie-Lena Schmalhofer; Sophie Götz; Lennart Well; Said Farschtschi; Victor-Felix Mautner; Inka Ristow; Rene Werner	Background and Objectives: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of numerous neurofibromas (NFs) throughout the body. Whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) is the clinical standard for detection and longitudinal surveillance of NF tumor growth. Existing interactive segmentation methods fail to combine high lesion-wise precision with scalability to hundreds of lesions. This study proposes a novel interactive segmentation model tailored to this challenge.   Methods: We introduce MOIS-SAM2, a multi-object interactive segmentation model that extends the state-of-the-art, transformer-based, promptable Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) with exemplar-based semantic propagation. MOIS-SAM2 was trained and evaluated on 119 WB-MRI scans from 84 NF1 patients acquired using T2-weighted fat-suppressed sequences. The dataset was split at the patient level into a training set and four test sets (one in-domain and three reflecting different domain shift scenarios, e.g., MRI field strength variation, low tumor burden, differences in clinical site and scanner vendor).   Results: On the in-domain test set, MOIS-SAM2 achieved a scan-wise DSC of 0.60 against expert manual annotations, outperforming baseline 3D nnU-Net (DSC: 0.54) and SAM2 (DSC: 0.35). Performance of the proposed model was maintained under MRI field strength shift (DSC: 0.53) and scanner vendor variation (DSC: 0.50), and improved in low tumor burden cases (DSC: 0.61). Lesion detection F1 scores ranged from 0.62 to 0.78 across test sets. Preliminary inter-reader variability analysis showed model-to-expert agreement (DSC: 0.62-0.68), comparable to inter-expert agreement (DSC: 0.57-0.69).   Conclusions: The proposed MOIS-SAM2 enables efficient and scalable interactive segmentation of NFs in WB-MRI with minimal user input and strong generalization, supporting integration into clinical workflows.	eess.IV; cs.AI; cs.CV; cs.LG	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.19259v1	Moving by Looking: Towards Vision-Driven Avatar Motion Generation	Markos Diomataris; Berat Mert Albaba; Giorgio Becherini; Partha Ghosh; Omid Taheri; Michael J. Black	The way we perceive the world fundamentally shapes how we move, whether it is how we navigate in a room or how we interact with other humans. Current human motion generation methods, neglect this interdependency and use task-specific ``perception'' that differs radically from that of humans. We argue that the generation of human-like avatar behavior requires human-like perception. Consequently, in this work we present CLOPS, the first human avatar that solely uses egocentric vision to perceive its surroundings and navigate. Using vision as the primary driver of motion however, gives rise to a significant challenge for training avatars: existing datasets have either isolated human motion, without the context of a scene, or lack scale. We overcome this challenge by decoupling the learning of low-level motion skills from learning of high-level control that maps visual input to motion. First, we train a motion prior model on a large motion capture dataset. Then, a policy is trained using Q-learning to map egocentric visual inputs to high-level control commands for the motion prior. Our experiments empirically demonstrate that egocentric vision can give rise to human-like motion characteristics in our avatars. For example, the avatars walk such that they avoid obstacles present in their visual field. These findings suggest that equipping avatars with human-like sensors, particularly egocentric vision, holds promise for training avatars that behave like humans.	cs.CV	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.19258v1	Graph-Radiomic Learning (GrRAiL) Descriptor to Characterize Imaging   Heterogeneity in Confounding Tumor Pathologies	Dheerendranath Battalapalli; Apoorva Safai; Maria Jaramillo; Hyemin Um; Gustavo Adalfo Pineda Ortiz; Ulas Bagci; Manmeet Singh Ahluwalia; Marwa Ismail; Pallavi Tiwari	A significant challenge in solid tumors is reliably distinguishing confounding pathologies from malignant neoplasms on routine imaging. While radiomics methods seek surrogate markers of lesion heterogeneity on CT/MRI, many aggregate features across the region of interest (ROI) and miss complex spatial relationships among varying intensity compositions. We present a new Graph-Radiomic Learning (GrRAiL) descriptor for characterizing intralesional heterogeneity (ILH) on clinical MRI scans. GrRAiL (1) identifies clusters of sub-regions using per-voxel radiomic measurements, then (2) computes graph-theoretic metrics to quantify spatial associations among clusters. The resulting weighted graphs encode higher-order spatial relationships within the ROI, aiming to reliably capture ILH and disambiguate confounding pathologies from malignancy. To assess efficacy and clinical feasibility, GrRAiL was evaluated in n=947 subjects spanning three use cases: differentiating tumor recurrence from radiation effects in glioblastoma (GBM; n=106) and brain metastasis (n=233), and stratifying pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) into no+low vs high risk (n=608). In a multi-institutional setting, GrRAiL consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines - Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), textural radiomics, and intensity-graph analysis. In GBM, cross-validation (CV) and test accuracies for recurrence vs pseudo-progression were 89% and 78% with >10% test-accuracy gains over comparators. In brain metastasis, CV and test accuracies for recurrence vs radiation necrosis were 84% and 74% (>13% improvement). For IPMN risk stratification, CV and test accuracies were 84% and 75%, showing >10% improvement.	cs.CV	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.19252v1	Adversarially-Refined VQ-GAN with Dense Motion Tokenization for   Spatio-Temporal Heatmaps	Gabriel Maldonado; Narges Rashvand; Armin Danesh Pazho; Ghazal Alinezhad Noghre; Vinit Katariya; Hamed Tabkhi	Continuous human motion understanding remains a core challenge in computer vision due to its high dimensionality and inherent redundancy. Efficient compression and representation are crucial for analyzing complex motion dynamics. In this work, we introduce an adversarially-refined VQ-GAN framework with dense motion tokenization for compressing spatio-temporal heatmaps while preserving the fine-grained traces of human motion. Our approach combines dense motion tokenization with adversarial refinement, which eliminates reconstruction artifacts like motion smearing and temporal misalignment observed in non-adversarial baselines. Our experiments on the CMU Panoptic dataset provide conclusive evidence of our method's superiority, outperforming the dVAE baseline by 9.31% SSIM and reducing temporal instability by 37.1%. Furthermore, our dense tokenization strategy enables a novel analysis of motion complexity, revealing that 2D motion can be optimally represented with a compact 128-token vocabulary, while 3D motion's complexity demands a much larger 1024-token codebook for faithful reconstruction. These results establish practical deployment feasibility across diverse motion analysis applications.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.19245v1	ConViS-Bench: Estimating Video Similarity Through Semantic Concepts	Benedetta Liberatori; Alessandro Conti; Lorenzo Vaquero; Yiming Wang; Elisa Ricci; Paolo Rota	What does it mean for two videos to be similar? Videos may appear similar when judged by the actions they depict, yet entirely different if evaluated based on the locations where they were filmed. While humans naturally compare videos by taking different aspects into account, this ability has not been thoroughly studied and presents a challenge for models that often depend on broad global similarity scores. Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with video understanding capabilities open new opportunities for leveraging natural language in comparative video tasks. We introduce Concept-based Video Similarity estimation (ConViS), a novel task that compares pairs of videos by computing interpretable similarity scores across a predefined set of key semantic concepts. ConViS allows for human-like reasoning about video similarity and enables new applications such as concept-conditioned video retrieval. To support this task, we also introduce ConViS-Bench, a new benchmark comprising carefully annotated video pairs spanning multiple domains. Each pair comes with concept-level similarity scores and textual descriptions of both differences and similarities. Additionally, we benchmark several state-of-the-art models on ConViS, providing insights into their alignment with human judgments. Our results reveal significant performance differences on ConViS, indicating that some concepts present greater challenges for estimating video similarity. We believe that ConViS-Bench will serve as a valuable resource for advancing research in language-driven video understanding.	cs.CV	2025-09-23

Unlike existing multimodal diffsion language models such as MMaDa and Muddit which only support simple image-level understanding tasks and low-resolution image generation, Lavida-O exhibits many new capabilities such as object grounding, image-editing, and high-resolution (1024px) image synthesis. It is also the first unified MDM that uses its understanding capabilities to improve image generation and editing results through planning and iterative self-reflection. To allow effective and efficient training and sampling, Lavida-O ntroduces many novel techniques such as Elastic Mixture-of-Transformer architecture, universal text conditioning, and stratified sampling. \ours~achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks such as RefCOCO object grounding, GenEval text-to-image generation, and ImgEdit image editing, outperforming existing autoregressive and continuous diffusion models such as Qwen2.5-VL and FluxKontext-dev, while offering considerable speedup at inference.	cs.CV	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.19153v1	LLMs as verification oracles for Solidity	Massimo Bartoletti; Enrico Lipparini; Livio Pompianu	Ensuring the correctness of smart contracts is critical, as even subtle flaws can lead to severe financial losses. While bug detection tools able to spot common vulnerability patterns can serve as a first line of defense, most real-world exploits and losses stem from errors in the contract business logic. Formal verification tools such as SolCMC and the Certora Prover address this challenge, but their impact remains limited by steep learning curves and restricted specification languages. Recent works have begun to explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for security-related tasks such as vulnerability detection and test generation. Yet, a fundamental question remains open: can LLMs serve as verification oracles, capable of reasoning about arbitrary contract-specific properties? In this paper, we provide the first systematic evaluation of GPT-5, a state-of-the-art reasoning LLM, in this role. We benchmark its performance on a large dataset of verification tasks, compare its outputs against those of established formal verification tools, and assess its practical effectiveness in real-world auditing scenarios. Our study combines quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis, and shows that recent reasoning-oriented LLMs can be surprisingly effective as verification oracles, suggesting a new frontier in the convergence of AI and formal methods for secure smart contract development and auditing.	cs.CR; cs.SE	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.19117v1	LLM-based Vulnerability Discovery through the Lens of Code Metrics	Felix Weissberg; Lukas Pirch; Erik Imgrund; Jonas Möller; Thorsten Eisenhofer; Konrad Rieck	Large language models (LLMs) excel in many tasks of software engineering, yet progress in leveraging them for vulnerability discovery has stalled in recent years. To understand this phenomenon, we investigate LLMs through the lens of classic code metrics. Surprisingly, we find that a classifier trained solely on these metrics performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs for vulnerability discovery. A root-cause analysis reveals a strong correlation and a causal effect between LLMs and code metrics: When the value of a metric is changed, LLM predictions tend to shift by a corresponding magnitude. This dependency suggests that LLMs operate at a similarly shallow level as code metrics, limiting their ability to grasp complex patterns and fully realize their potential in vulnerability discovery. Based on these findings, we derive recommendations on how research should more effectively address this challenge.	cs.CR; cs.LG; cs.SE	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.19101v1	Trigger Where It Hurts: Unveiling Hidden Backdoors through Sensitivity   with Sensitron	Gejian Zhao; Hanzhou Wu; Xinpeng Zhang	Backdoor attacks pose a significant security threat to natural language processing (NLP) systems, but existing methods lack explainable trigger mechanisms and fail to quantitatively model vulnerability patterns. This work pioneers the quantitative connection between explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and backdoor attacks, introducing Sensitron, a novel modular framework for crafting stealthy and robust backdoor triggers. Sensitron employs a progressive refinement approach where Dynamic Meta-Sensitivity Analysis (DMSA) first identifies potentially vulnerable input tokens, Hierarchical SHAP Estimation (H-SHAP) then provides explainable attribution to precisely pinpoint the most influential tokens, and finally a Plug-and-Rank mechanism that generates contextually appropriate triggers. We establish the first mathematical correlation (Sensitivity Ranking Correlation, SRC=0.83) between explainability scores and empirical attack success, enabling precise targeting of model vulnerabilities. Sensitron achieves 97.8% Attack Success Rate (ASR) (+5.8% over state-of-the-art (SOTA)) with 85.4% ASR at 0.1% poisoning rate, demonstrating robust resistance against multiple SOTA defenses. This work reveals fundamental NLP vulnerabilities and provides new attack vectors through weaponized explainability.	cs.CR	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.18934v1	Generic Adversarial Smart Contract Detection with Semantics and   Uncertainty-Aware LLM	Yating Liu; Xing Su; Hao Wu; Sijin Li; Yuxi Cheng; Fengyuan Xu; Sheng Zhong	Adversarial smart contracts, mostly on EVM-compatible chains like Ethereum and BSC, are deployed as EVM bytecode to exploit vulnerable smart contracts typically for financial gains. Detecting such malicious contracts at the time of deployment is an important proactive strategy preventing loss from victim contracts. It offers a better cost-benefit than detecting vulnerabilities on diverse potential victims. However, existing works are not generic with limited detection types and effectiveness due to imbalanced samples, while the emerging LLM technologies, which show its potentials in generalization, have two key problems impeding its application in this task: hard digestion of compiled-code inputs, especially those with task-specific logic, and hard assessment of LLMs' certainty in their binary answers, i.e., yes-or-no answers. Therefore, we propose a generic adversarial smart contracts detection framework FinDet, which leverages LLMs with two enhancements addressing above two problems. FinDet takes as input only the EVM-bytecode contracts and identifies adversarial ones among them with high balanced accuracy. The first enhancement extracts concise semantic intentions and high-level behavioral logic from the low-level bytecode inputs, unleashing the LLM reasoning capability restricted by the task input. The second enhancement probes and measures the LLM uncertainty to its multi-round answering to the same query, improving the LLM answering robustness for binary classifications required by the task output. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that FinDet achieves a BAC of 0.9223 and a TPR of 0.8950, significantly outperforming existing baselines. It remains robust under challenging conditions including unseen attack patterns, low-data settings, and feature obfuscation. FinDet detects all 5 public and 20+ unreported adversarial contracts in a 10-day real-world test, confirmed manually.	cs.CR	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.18909v1	Obelix: Mitigating Side-Channels Through Dynamic Obfuscation	"Jan Wichelmann; Anja Rabich; Anna P""atschke; Thomas Eisenbarth"	Trusted execution environments (TEEs) offer hardware-assisted means to protect code and data. However, as shown in numerous results over the years, attackers can use side-channels to leak data access patterns and even single-step the code. While the vendors are slowly introducing hardware-based countermeasures for some attacks, others will stay unaddressed. This makes a software-level countermeasure desirable, but current available solutions only address very specific attack vectors or have a narrow leakage model.   In this work, we take a holistic view at the vulnerabilities of TEEs and design a tool named Obelix, which is the first to protect both code and data against a wide range of TEE attacks, from cache attacks over single-stepping to ciphertext side-channels. We analyze the practically achievable precision of state-of-the-art single-stepping tools, and present an algorithm which uses that knowledge to divide a program into uniform code blocks, that are indistinguishable for a strong attacker. By storing these blocks and the program data in oblivious RAM, the attacker cannot follow execution, effectively protecting both secret code and data. We describe how we automate our approach to make it available for developers who are unfamiliar with side-channels. As an obfuscation tool, Obelix comes with a considerable performance overhead, but compensates this with strong security guarantees and easy applicability without requiring any expert knowledge.	cs.CR	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.18886v1	Confidential LLM Inference: Performance and Cost Across CPU and GPU TEEs	Marcin Chrapek; Marcin Copik; Etienne Mettaz; Torsten Hoefler	Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on converged Cloud and High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure. However, as LLMs handle confidential inputs and are fine-tuned on costly, proprietary datasets, their heightened security requirements slow adoption in privacy-sensitive sectors such as healthcare and finance. We investigate methods to address this gap and propose Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) as a solution for securing end-to-end LLM inference. We validate their practicality by evaluating these compute-intensive workloads entirely within CPU and GPU TEEs. On the CPU side, we conduct an in-depth study running full Llama2 inference pipelines (7B, 13B, 70B) inside Intel's TDX and SGX, accelerated by Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX). We derive 12 insights, including that across various data types, batch sizes, and input lengths, CPU TEEs impose under 10% throughput and 20% latency overheads, further reduced by AMX. We run LLM inference on NVIDIA H100 Confidential Compute GPUs, contextualizing our CPU findings and observing throughput penalties of 4-8% that diminish as batch and input sizes grow. By comparing performance, cost, and security trade-offs, we show how CPU TEEs can be more cost-effective or secure than their GPU counterparts. To our knowledge, our work is the first to comprehensively demonstrate the performance and practicality of modern TEEs across both CPUs and GPUs for enabling confidential LLMs (cLLMs).	cs.PF; cs.AR; cs.CR; cs.LG	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.18871v1	R-CONV++: Uncovering Privacy Vulnerabilities through Analytical Gradient   Inversion Attacks	Tamer Ahmed Eltaras; Qutaibah Malluhi; Alessandro Savino; Stefano Di Carlo; Adnan Qayyum	Federated learning has emerged as a prominent privacy-preserving technique for leveraging large-scale distributed datasets by sharing gradients instead of raw data. However, recent studies indicate that private training data can still be exposed through gradient inversion attacks. While earlier analytical methods have demonstrated success in reconstructing input data from fully connected layers, their effectiveness significantly diminishes when applied to convolutional layers, high-dimensional inputs, and scenarios involving multiple training examples. This paper extends our previous work \cite{eltaras2024r} and proposes three advanced algorithms to broaden the applicability of gradient inversion attacks. The first algorithm presents a novel data leakage method that efficiently exploits convolutional layer gradients, demonstrating that even with non-fully invertible activation functions, such as ReLU, training samples can be analytically reconstructed directly from gradients without the need to reconstruct intermediate layer outputs. Building on this foundation, the second algorithm extends this analytical approach to support high-dimensional input data, substantially enhancing its utility across complex real-world datasets. The third algorithm introduces an innovative analytical method for reconstructing mini-batches, addressing a critical gap in current research that predominantly focuses on reconstructing only a single training example. Unlike previous studies that focused mainly on the weight constraints of convolutional layers, our approach emphasizes the pivotal role of gradient constraints, revealing that successful attacks can be executed with fewer than 5\% of the constraints previously deemed necessary in certain layers.	cs.CR	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.18800v1	Security Evaluation of Android apps in budget African Mobile Devices	Alioune Diallo; Anta Diop; Abdoul Kader Kabore; Jordan Samhi; Aleksandr Pilgun; Tegawendé F. Bissyande; Jacque Klein	Android's open-source nature facilitates widespread smartphone accessibility, particularly in price-sensitive markets. System and vendor applications that come pre-installed on budget Android devices frequently operate with elevated privileges, yet they receive limited independent examination. To address this gap, we developed a framework that extracts APKs from physical devices and applies static analysis to identify privacy and security issues in embedded software. Our study examined 1,544 APKs collected from seven African smartphones. The analysis revealed that 145 applications (9%) disclose sensitive data, 249 (16%) expose critical components without sufficient safeguards, and many present additional risks: 226 execute privileged or dangerous commands, 79 interact with SMS messages (read, send, or delete), and 33 perform silent installation operations. We also uncovered a vendor-supplied package that appears to transmit device identifiers and location details to an external third party. These results demonstrate that pre-installed applications on widely distributed low-cost devices represent a significant and underexplored threat to user security and privacy.	cs.CR; cs.SE	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.18790v1	Detection of security smells in IaC scripts through semantics-aware code   and language processing	Aicha War; Adnan A. Rawass; Abdoul K. Kabore; Jordan Samhi; Jacques Klein; Tegawende F. Bissyande	Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates the provisioning and management of IT infrastructure through scripts and tools, streamlining software deployment. Prior studies have shown that IaC scripts often contain recurring security misconfigurations, and several detection and mitigation approaches have been proposed. Most of these rely on static analysis, using statistical code representations or Machine Learning (ML) classifiers to distinguish insecure configurations from safe code.   In this work, we introduce a novel approach that enhances static analysis with semantic understanding by jointly leveraging natural language and code representations. Our method builds on two complementary ML models: CodeBERT, to capture semantics across code and text, and LongFormer, to represent long IaC scripts without losing contextual information. We evaluate our approach on misconfiguration datasets from two widely used IaC tools, Ansible and Puppet. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct two ablation studies (removing code text from the natural language input and truncating scripts to reduce context) and compare against four large language models (LLMs) and prior work. Results show that semantic enrichment substantially improves detection, raising precision and recall from 0.46 and 0.79 to 0.92 and 0.88 on Ansible, and from 0.55 and 0.97 to 0.87 and 0.75 on Puppet, respectively.	cs.CR; cs.AI; cs.LG; cs.SE	2025-09-23
10.48550/arXiv.2509.18761v1	Security smells in infrastructure as code: a taxonomy update beyond the   seven sins	Aicha War; Serge L. B. Nikiema; Jordan Samhi; Jacques Klein; Tegawende F. Bissyande	Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has become essential for modern software management, yet security flaws in IaC scripts can have severe consequences, as exemplified by the recurring exploits of Cloud Web Services. Prior work has recognized the need to build a precise taxonomy of security smells in IaC scripts as a first step towards developing approaches to improve IaC security. This first effort led to the unveiling of seven sins, limited by the focus on a single IaC tool as well as by the extensive, and potentially biased, manual effort that was required. We propose, in our work, to revisit this taxonomy: first, we extend the study of IaC security smells to a more diverse dataset with scripts associated with seven popular IaC tools, including Terraform, Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Pulumi, Saltstack, and Vagrant; second, we bring in some automation for the analysis by relying on an LLM. While we leverage LLMs for initial pattern processing, all taxonomic decisions underwent systematic human validation and reconciliation with established security standards. Our study yields a comprehensive taxonomy of 62 security smell categories, significantly expanding beyond the previously known seven. We demonstrate actionability by implementing new security checking rules within linters for seven popular IaC tools, often achieving 1.00 precision score. Our evolution study of security smells in GitHub projects reveals that these issues persist for extended periods, likely due to inadequate detection and mitigation tools. This work provides IaC practitioners with insights for addressing common security smells and systematically adopting DevSecOps practices to build safer infrastructure code.	cs.CR; cs.AI; cs.LG; cs.SE	2025-09-23
