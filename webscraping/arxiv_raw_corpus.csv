The model is pretrained on a 206B-token corpus spanning scientific text, pure sequences, and sequence-text pairs, then aligned via SFT on 40M instructions, annealed cold-start bootstrapping to elicit long-form chain-of-thought, and reinforcement learning with task-specific reward shaping, which instills deliberate scientific reasoning. It supports four capability families, covering up to 103 tasks across workflows: (i) faithful translation between text and scientific formats, (ii) text/knowledge extraction, (iii) property prediction, (iv) property classification, (v) unconditional and conditional sequence generation and design. Compared with specialist systems, our approach broadens instruction coverage, improves cross-domain generalization, and enhances fidelity. We detail data curation and training and show that cross-discipline learning strengthens transfer and downstream reliability. The model, instruct tuning datasets and the evaluation code are open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/SciReason and https://github.com/open-sciencelab/SciReason.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.21319v1	RLBFF: Binary Flexible Feedback to bridge between Human Feedback &   Verifiable Rewards	Zhilin Wang; Jiaqi Zeng; Olivier Delalleau; Ellie Evans; Daniel Egert; Hoo-Chang Shin; Felipe Soares; Yi Dong; Oleksii Kuchaiev	Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness. RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g. accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24, 2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21317v1	Interactive Recommendation Agent with Active User Commands	Jiakai Tang; Yujie Luo; Xunke Xi; Fei Sun; Xueyang Feng; Sunhao Dai; Chao Yi; Dian Chen; Zhujin Gao; Yang Li; Xu Chen; Wen Chen; Jian Wu; Yuning Jiang; Bo Zheng	Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that limit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these coarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness.   To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation Feed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support this paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and long-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both user satisfaction and business outcomes.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.21305v1	Sycophancy Is Not One Thing: Causal Separation of Sycophantic Behaviors   in LLMs	Daniel Vennemeyer; Phan Anh Duong; Tiffany Zhan; Tianyu Jiang	Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behaviors -- such as excessive agreement with or flattery of the user -- but it is unclear whether these behaviors arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes. We decompose sycophancy into sycophantic agreement and sycophantic praise, contrasting both with genuine agreement. Using difference-in-means directions, activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models and datasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinct linear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independently amplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) their representational structure is consistent across model families and scales. These results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct, independently steerable representations.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.21294v1	The role of synthetic data in Multilingual, Multi-cultural AI systems:   Lessons from Indic Languages	Pranjal A. Chitale; Varun Gumma; Sanchit Ahuja; Prashant Kodali; Manan Uppadhyay; Deepthi Sudharsan; Sunayana Sitaram	Developing AI systems that operate effectively across languages while remaining culturally grounded is a long-standing challenge, particularly in low-resource settings. Synthetic data provides a promising avenue, yet its effectiveness in multilingual and multicultural contexts remains underexplored. We investigate the creation and impact of synthetic, culturally contextualized datasets for Indian languages through a bottom-up generation strategy that prompts large open-source LLMs (>= 235B parameters) to ground data generation in language-specific Wikipedia content. This approach complements the dominant top-down paradigm of translating synthetic datasets from high-resource languages such as English. We introduce Updesh, a high-quality large-scale synthetic instruction-following dataset comprising 9.5M data points across 13 Indian languages, encompassing diverse reasoning and generative tasks with an emphasis on long-context, multi-turn capabilities, and alignment with Indian cultural contexts. A comprehensive evaluation incorporating both automated metrics and human annotation across 10k assessments indicates that generated data is high quality; though, human evaluation highlights areas for further improvement. Additionally, we perform downstream evaluations by fine-tuning models on our dataset and assessing the performance across 15 diverse multilingual datasets. Models trained on Updesh consistently achieve significant gains on generative tasks and remain competitive on multiple-choice style NLU tasks. Notably, relative improvements are most pronounced in low and medium-resource languages, narrowing their gap with high-resource languages. These findings provide empirical evidence that effective multilingual AI requires multi-faceted data curation and generation strategies that incorporate context-aware, culturally grounded methodologies.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21287v1	DisCoCLIP: A Distributional Compositional Tensor Network Encoder for   Vision-Language Understanding	Kin Ian Lo; Hala Hawashin; Mina Abbaszadeh; Tilen Limback-Stokin; Hadi Wazni; Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh	Recent vision-language models excel at large-scale image-text alignment but often neglect the compositional structure of language, leading to failures on tasks that hinge on word order and predicate-argument structure. We introduce DisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer with a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic structure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of millions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised contrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and word order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%, boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves 93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark. These results demonstrate that embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.

Although many methods aim to mitigate such impact by optimizing prompts, a theoretical explanation of how these perturbations influence CoT outputs remains an open area of research. This gap limits our in-depth understanding of how input perturbations propagate during the reasoning process and hinders further improvements in prompt optimization methods. Therefore, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the effect of input perturbations on the fluctuation of CoT outputs. We first derive an upper bound for input perturbations under the condition that the output fluctuation is within an acceptable range, based on which we prove that: (i) This upper bound is positively correlated with the number of reasoning steps in the CoT; (ii) Even an infinitely long reasoning process cannot eliminate the impact of input perturbations. We then apply these conclusions to the Linear Self-Attention (LSA) model, which can be viewed as a simplified version of the Transformer. For the LSA model, we prove that the upper bound for input perturbation is negatively correlated with the norms of the input embedding and hidden state vectors. To validate this theoretical analysis, we conduct experiments on three mainstream datasets and four mainstream models. The experimental results align with our theoretical analysis, empirically demonstrating the correctness of our findings.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.21269v1	LLMTrace: A Corpus for Classification and Fine-Grained Localization of   AI-Written Text	Irina Tolstykh; Aleksandra Tsybina; Sergey Yakubson; Maksim Kuprashevich	The widespread use of human-like text from Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates the development of robust detection systems. However, progress is limited by a critical lack of suitable training data; existing datasets are often generated with outdated models, are predominantly in English, and fail to address the increasingly common scenario of mixed human-AI authorship. Crucially, while some datasets address mixed authorship, none provide the character-level annotations required for the precise localization of AI-generated segments within a text. To address these gaps, we introduce LLMTrace, a new large-scale, bilingual (English and Russian) corpus for AI-generated text detection. Constructed using a diverse range of modern proprietary and open-source LLMs, our dataset is designed to support two key tasks: traditional full-text binary classification (human vs. AI) and the novel task of AI-generated interval detection, facilitated by character-level annotations. We believe LLMTrace will serve as a vital resource for training and evaluating the next generation of more nuanced and practical AI detection models.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21267v1	LLM Output Homogenization is Task Dependent	Shomik Jain; Jack Lanchantin; Maximilian Nickel; Karen Ullrich; Ashia Wilson; Jamelle Watson-Daniels	A large language model can be less helpful if it exhibits output response homogenization. But whether two responses are considered homogeneous, and whether such homogenization is problematic, both depend on the task category. For instance, in objective math tasks, we often expect no variation in the final answer but anticipate variation in the problem-solving strategy. Whereas, for creative writing tasks, we may expect variation in key narrative components (e.g. plot, genre, setting, etc), beyond the vocabulary or embedding diversity produced by temperature-sampling. Previous work addressing output homogenization often fails to conceptualize diversity in a task-dependent way. We address this gap in the literature directly by making the following contributions. (1) We present a task taxonomy comprised of eight task categories that each have distinct conceptualizations of output homogenization. (2) We introduce task-anchored functional diversity to better evaluate output homogenization. (3) We propose a task-anchored sampling technique that increases functional diversity for task categories where homogenization is undesired, while preserving homogenization where it is desired. (4) We challenge the perceived existence of a diversity-quality trade-off by increasing functional diversity while maintaining response quality. Overall, we demonstrate how task dependence improves the evaluation and mitigation of output homogenization.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.21262v1	Un-Doubling Diffusion: LLM-guided Disambiguation of Homonym Duplication	Evgeny Kaskov; Elizaveta Petrova; Petr Surovtsev; Anna Kostikova; Ilya Mistiurin; Alexander Kapitanov; Alexander Nagaev	Homonyms are words with identical spelling but distinct meanings, which pose challenges for many generative models. When a homonym appears in a prompt, diffusion models may generate multiple senses of the word simultaneously, which is known as homonym duplication. This issue is further complicated by an Anglocentric bias, which includes an additional translation step before the text-to-image model pipeline. As a result, even words that are not homonymous in the original language may become homonyms and lose their meaning after translation into English. In this paper, we introduce a method for measuring duplication rates and conduct evaluations of different diffusion models using both automatic evaluation utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human evaluation. Additionally, we investigate methods to mitigate the homonym duplication problem through prompt expansion, demonstrating that this approach also effectively reduces duplication related to Anglocentric bias. The code for the automatic evaluation pipeline is publicly available.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.21257v1	Hallucination as an Upper Bound: A New Perspective on Text-to-Image   Evaluation	Seyed Amir Kasaei; Mohammad Hossein Rohban	In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations. This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.21237v1	Query-Centric Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation	Yaxiong Wu; Jianyuan Bo; Yongyue Zhang; Sheng Liang; Yong Liu	Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge for long-context understanding and multi-hop reasoning, but existing methods face a granularity dilemma: fine-grained entity-level graphs incur high token costs and lose context, while coarse document-level graphs fail to capture nuanced relations. We introduce QCG-RAG, a query-centric graph RAG framework that enables query-granular indexing and multi-hop chunk retrieval. Our query-centric approach leverages Doc2Query and Doc2Query{-}{-} to construct query-centric graphs with controllable granularity, improving graph quality and interpretability. A tailored multi-hop retrieval mechanism then selects relevant chunks via the generated queries. Experiments on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG show that QCG-RAG consistently outperforms prior chunk-based and graph-based RAG methods in question answering accuracy, establishing a new paradigm for multi-hop reasoning.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21227v1	Evaluating the Evaluators: Metrics for Compositional Text-to-Image   Generation	Seyed Amir Kasaei; Ali Aghayari; Arash Marioriyad; Niki Sepasian; MohammadAmin Fazli; Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah; Mohammad Hossein Rohban	Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation. Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment. These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models in generation.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21223v1	Sigma: Semantically Informative Pre-training for Skeleton-based Sign   Language Understanding	Muxin Pu; Mei Kuan Lim; Chun Yong Chong; Chen Change Loy	Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance between local details and global context, with models either focusing too narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3) inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises agreements across different levels of paired features from different modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution for SLU.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21212v1	SGMem: Sentence Graph Memory for Long-Term Conversational Agents	Yaxiong Wu; Yongyue Zhang; Sheng Liang; Yong Liu	Long-term conversational agents require effective memory management to handle dialogue histories that exceed the context window of large language models (LLMs). Existing methods based on fact extraction or summarization reduce redundancy but struggle to organize and retrieve relevant information across different granularities of dialogue and generated memory. We introduce SGMem (Sentence Graph Memory), which represents dialogue as sentence-level graphs within chunked units, capturing associations across turn-, round-, and session-level contexts. By combining retrieved raw dialogue with generated memory such as summaries, facts and insights, SGMem supplies LLMs with coherent and relevant context for response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and LoCoMo show that SGMem consistently improves accuracy and outperforms strong baselines in long-term conversational question answering.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21208v1	CLaw: Benchmarking Chinese Legal Knowledge in Large Language Models - A   Fine-grained Corpus and Reasoning Analysis	Xinzhe Xu; Liang Zhao; Hongshen Xu; Chen Chen	Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with analyzing legal texts and citing relevant statutes, yet their reliability is often compromised by general pre-training that ingests legal texts without specialized focus, obscuring the true depth of their legal knowledge. This paper introduces CLaw, a novel benchmark specifically engineered to meticulously evaluate LLMs on Chinese legal knowledge and its application in reasoning. CLaw comprises two key components: (1) a comprehensive, fine-grained corpus of all 306 Chinese national statutes, segmented to the subparagraph level and incorporating precise historical revision timesteps for rigorous recall evaluation (64,849 entries), and (2) a challenging set of 254 case-based reasoning instances derived from China Supreme Court curated materials to assess the practical application of legal knowledge. Our empirical evaluation reveals that most contemporary LLMs significantly struggle to faithfully reproduce legal provisions. As accurate retrieval and citation of legal provisions form the basis of legal reasoning, this deficiency critically undermines the reliability of their responses. We contend that achieving trustworthy legal reasoning in LLMs requires a robust synergy of accurate knowledge retrieval--potentially enhanced through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)--and strong general reasoning capabilities. This work provides an essential benchmark and critical insights for advancing domain-specific LLM reasoning, particularly within the complex legal sphere.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.21205v1	TABLET: A Large-Scale Dataset for Robust Visual Table Understanding	Iñigo Alonso; Imanol Miranda; Eneko Agirre; Mirella Lapata	While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4 million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88% preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

First, explicit retrieval fragments reasoning, imposing a hidden ""tool tax"" of extra tokens and steps. Second, multi-agent pipelines often dilute strong solutions by averaging across all candidates. We address these challenges with a unified framework that combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration. At its foundation, a Monitor-based retrieval module operates at the token level, integrating external knowledge with minimal disruption to reasoning. On top of this substrate, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) iteratively designates each candidate as an anchor to be repaired by its peers, while Quality-Aware Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) adapts refinement to solution quality. On Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold, our framework achieves 48.3\% accuracy -- the highest reported to date, surpassing the strongest agent baseline by 13.4 points and leading frontier LLMs by up to 18.1 points, while simultaneously reducing token usage by 53.5\% and agent steps by 43.7\%. Results on SuperGPQA and TRQA confirm robustness across domains. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures and knowledge gaps co-occur in over 85\% of cases, while diversity analysis reveals a clear dichotomy: retrieval tasks benefit from solution variety, whereas reasoning tasks favor consensus. Together, these findings demonstrate how implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome the inefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21192v1	GEP: A GCG-Based method for extracting personally identifiable   information from chatbots built on small language models	Jieli Zhu; Vi Ngoc-Nha Tran	Small language models (SLMs) become unprecedentedly appealing due to their approximately equivalent performance compared to large language models (LLMs) in certain fields with less energy and time consumption during training and inference. However, the personally identifiable information (PII) leakage of SLMs for downstream tasks has yet to be explored. In this study, we investigate the PII leakage of the chatbot based on SLM. We first finetune a new chatbot, i.e., ChatBioGPT based on the backbone of BioGPT using medical datasets Alpaca and HealthCareMagic. It shows a matchable performance in BERTscore compared with previous studies of ChatDoctor and ChatGPT. Based on this model, we prove that the previous template-based PII attacking methods cannot effectively extract the PII in the dataset for leakage detection under the SLM condition. We then propose GEP, which is a greedy coordinate gradient-based (GCG) method specifically designed for PII extraction. We conduct experimental studies of GEP and the results show an increment of up to 60$\times$ more leakage compared with the previous template-based methods. We further expand the capability of GEP in the case of a more complicated and realistic situation by conducting free-style insertion where the inserted PII in the dataset is in the form of various syntactic expressions instead of fixed templates, and GEP is still able to reveal a PII leakage rate of up to 4.53%.

An Overview of Computational Humour Generation and   Explanation	Tyler Loakman; William Thorne; Chenghua Lin	The creation and perception of humour is a fundamental human trait, positioning its computational understanding as one of the most challenging tasks in natural language processing (NLP). As an abstract, creative, and frequently context-dependent construct, humour requires extensive reasoning to understand and create, making it a pertinent task for assessing the common-sense knowledge and reasoning abilities of modern large language models (LLMs). In this work, we survey the landscape of computational humour as it pertains to the generative tasks of creation and explanation. We observe that, despite the task of understanding humour bearing all the hallmarks of a foundational NLP task, work on generating and explaining humour beyond puns remains sparse, while state-of-the-art models continue to fall short of human capabilities. We bookend our literature survey by motivating the importance of computational humour processing as a subdiscipline of NLP and presenting an extensive discussion of future directions for research in the area that takes into account the subjective and ethically ambiguous nature of humour.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21155v1	Learning the Wrong Lessons: Syntactic-Domain Spurious Correlations in   Language Models	Chantal Shaib; Vinith M. Suriyakumar; Levent Sagun; Byron C. Wallace; Marzyeh Ghassemi	For an LLM to correctly respond to an instruction it must understand both the semantics and the domain (i.e., subject area) of a given task-instruction pair. However, syntax can also convey implicit information Recent work shows that syntactic templates--frequent sequences of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags--are prevalent in training data and often appear in model outputs. In this work we characterize syntactic templates, domain, and semantics in task-instruction pairs. We identify cases of spurious correlations between syntax and domain, where models learn to associate a domain with syntax during training; this can sometimes override prompt semantics. Using a synthetic training dataset, we find that the syntactic-domain correlation can lower performance (mean 0.51 +/- 0.06) on entity knowledge tasks in OLMo-2 models (1B-13B). We introduce an evaluation framework to detect this phenomenon in trained models, and show that it occurs on a subset of the FlanV2 dataset in open (OLMo-2-7B; Llama-4-Maverick), and closed (GPT-4o) models. Finally, we present a case study on the implications for safety finetuning, showing that unintended syntactic-domain correlations can be used to bypass refusals in OLMo-2-7B Instruct and GPT-4o. Our findings highlight two needs: (1) to explicitly test for syntactic-domain correlations, and (2) to ensure syntactic diversity in training data, specifically within domains, to prevent such spurious correlations.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21151v1	Retrieval over Classification: Integrating Relation Semantics for   Multimodal Relation Extraction	Lei Hei; Tingjing Liao; Yingxin Pei; Yiyang Qi; Jiaqi Wang; Ruiting Li; Feiliang Ren	Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify semantic relations between entities in unstructured text. Although recent work extends traditional RE to multimodal scenarios, most approaches still adopt classification-based paradigms with fused multimodal features, representing relations as discrete labels. This paradigm has two significant limitations: (1) it overlooks structural constraints like entity types and positional cues, and (2) it lacks semantic expressiveness for fine-grained relation understanding. We propose \underline{R}etrieval \underline{O}ver \underline{C}lassification (ROC), a novel framework that reformulates multimodal RE as a retrieval task driven by relation semantics. ROC integrates entity type and positional information through a multimodal encoder, expands relation labels into natural language descriptions using a large language model, and aligns entity-relation pairs via semantic similarity-based contrastive learning. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets MNRE and MORE and exhibits stronger robustness and interpretability.

In-vehicle GUIs present distinct challenges: drivers' limited attention, strict safety requirements, and complex location-based interaction patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce Automotive-ENV, the first high-fidelity benchmark and interaction environment tailored for vehicle GUIs. This platform defines 185 parameterized tasks spanning explicit control, implicit intent understanding, and safety-aware tasks, and provides structured multimodal observations with precise programmatic checks for reproducible evaluation. Building on this benchmark, we propose ASURADA, a geo-aware multimodal agent that integrates GPS-informed context to dynamically adjust actions based on location, environmental conditions, and regional driving norms. Experiments show that geo-aware information significantly improves success on safety-aware tasks, highlighting the importance of location-based context in automotive environments. We will release Automotive-ENV, complete with all tasks and benchmarking tools, to further the development of safe and adaptive in-vehicle agents.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025

This paper propose a new dataset that enables systematic analysis of this phenomenon, containing 9,208 speech samples across three categories: Gender-Independent, Gender-Stereotypical, and Gender-Dependent. We further evaluated LLaMA-Omni series and discovered a paradoxical pattern; while overall responses seems identical regardless of gender, the pattern is far from unbiased responses. Specifically, in Gender-Stereotypical questions, all models consistently exhibited male-oriented responses; meanwhile, in Gender-Dependent questions where gender differentiation would be contextually appropriate, models exhibited responses independent to gender instead. We also confirm that this pattern does not result from neutral options nor perceived gender of a voice. When we allow neutral response, models tends to respond neutrally also in Gender-Dependent questions. The paradoxical pattern yet retains when we applied gender neutralization methods on speech. Through comparison between SpeechLMs with corresponding backbone LLMs, we confirmed that these paradoxical patterns primarily stem from Whisper speech encoders, which generates male-oriented acoustic tokens. These findings reveal that current SpeechLMs may not successfully remove gender biases though they prioritized general fairness principles over contextual appropriateness, highlighting the need for more sophisticated techniques to utilize gender information properly in speech technology.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21124v1	Expanding Reasoning Potential in Foundation Model by Learning Diverse   Chains of Thought Patterns	Xuemiao Zhang; Can Ren; Chengying Tu; Rongxiang Weng; Shuo Wang; Hongfei Yan; Jingang Wang; Xunliang Cai	Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only 10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21117v1	TrustJudge: Inconsistencies of LLM-as-a-Judge and How to Alleviate Them	Yidong Wang; Yunze Song; Tingyuan Zhu; Xuanwang Zhang; Zhuohao Yu; Hao Chen; Chiyu Song; Qiufeng Wang; Cunxiang Wang; Zhen Wu; Xinyu Dai; Yue Zhang; Wei Ye; Shikun Zhang	The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators (LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1) Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1) distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment. The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without requiring additional training or human annotations.

Due to the nature of speech, social bias in Spoken Language Models (SLMs) can emerge from two distinct sources: 1) content aspect and 2) acoustic aspect. The dataset converts every BBQ context into controlled voice conditions, enabling per-axis accuracy, bias, and consistency scores that remain comparable to the original text benchmark. Using VoiceBBQ, we evaluate two SLMs - LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio - and observe architectural contrasts: LLaMA-Omni resists acoustic bias while amplifying gender and accent bias, whereas Qwen2-Audio substantially dampens these cues while preserving content fidelity. VoiceBBQ thus provides a compact, drop-in testbed for jointly diagnosing content and acoustic bias across spoken language models.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.21106v1	BESPOKE: Benchmark for Search-Augmented Large Language Model   Personalization via Diagnostic Feedback	Hyunseo Kim; Sangam Lee; Kwangwook Seo; Dongha Lee	Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) have advanced information-seeking tasks by integrating retrieval into generation, reducing users' cognitive burden compared to traditional search systems. Yet they remain insufficient for fully addressing diverse user needs, which requires recognizing how the same query can reflect different intents across users and delivering information in preferred forms. While recent systems such as ChatGPT and Gemini attempt personalization by leveraging user histories, systematic evaluation of such personalization is under-explored. To address this gap, we propose BESPOKE, the realistic benchmark for evaluating personalization in search-augmented LLMs. BESPOKE is designed to be both realistic, by collecting authentic chat and search histories directly from humans, and diagnostic, by pairing responses with fine-grained preference scores and feedback. The benchmark is constructed through long-term, deeply engaged human annotation, where human annotators contributed their own histories, authored queries with detailed information needs, and evaluated responses with scores and diagnostic feedback. Leveraging BESPOKE, we conduct systematic analyses that reveal key requirements for effective personalization in information-seeking tasks, providing a foundation for fine-grained evaluation of personalized search-augmented LLMs. Our code and data are available at https://augustinlib.github.io/BESPOKE/.

PerHalluEval (Persian Hallucination Evaluation) is the first dynamic hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored for the Persian language. Our benchmark leverages a three-stage LLM-driven pipeline, augmented with human validation, to generate plausible answers and summaries regarding QA and summarization tasks, focusing on detecting extrinsic and intrinsic hallucinations. Moreover, we used the log probabilities of generated tokens to select the most believable hallucinated instances. In addition, we engaged human annotators to highlight Persian-specific contexts in the QA dataset in order to evaluate LLMs' performance on content specifically related to Persian culture. Our evaluation of 12 LLMs, including open- and closed-source models using PerHalluEval, revealed that the models generally struggle in detecting hallucinated Persian text. We showed that providing external knowledge, i.e., the original document for the summarization task, could mitigate hallucination partially. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of hallucination when comparing LLMs specifically trained for Persian with others.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025

On Cultural Positioning Bias and   Agentic Mitigation in LLMs	Yixin Wan; Xingrun Chen; Kai-Wei Chang	Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a wide range of downstream generative applications. However, we found that they also risk perpetuating subtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the perspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient externality towards non-mainstream ones. In this work, we identify and systematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an LLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other cultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000 generation prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through the lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an LLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10 diverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a stark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of US-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider stances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2 inference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness Intervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness Agents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent) introduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines. (2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized agents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates initial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates feedback to produce a polished, unbiased script). Empirical results showcase the effectiveness of agent-based methods as a promising direction for mitigating biases in generative LLMs.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.21079v1	SoM-1K: A Thousand-Problem Benchmark Dataset for Strength of Materials	Qixin Wan; Zilong Wang; Jingwen Zhou; Wanting Wang; Ziheng Geng; Jiachen Liu; Ran Cao; Minghui Cheng; Lu Cheng	Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities in various domains, but their performance on complex, multimodal engineering problems remains largely unexplored. We introduce SoM-1K, the first large-scale multimodal benchmark dataset dedicated to evaluating foundation models on problems in the strength of materials (SoM). The dataset, which contains 1,065 annotated SoM problems, mirrors real-world engineering tasks by including both textual problem statements and schematic diagrams. Due to the limited capabilities of current foundation models in understanding complicated visual information, we propose a novel prompting strategy called Descriptions of Images (DoI), which provides rigorous expert-generated text descriptions of the visual diagrams as the context. We evaluate eight representative foundation models, including both large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). Our results show that current foundation models struggle significantly with these engineering problems, with the best-performing model achieving only 56.6% accuracy. Interestingly, we found that LLMs, when provided with DoI, often outperform VLMs provided with visual diagrams. A detailed error analysis reveals that DoI plays a crucial role in mitigating visual misinterpretation errors, suggesting that accurate text-based descriptions can be more effective than direct image input for current foundation models. This work establishes a rigorous benchmark for engineering AI and highlights a critical need for developing more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models, particularly in scientific and engineering contexts.

Recent efforts have explored automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model, which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between ""Thinking"" and ""NoThinking"" modes. We then train a specialized difficult problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a 65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500, outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code: https://github.com/QizhiPei/ScaleDiff."

However, existing methods still lack strong theoretical guarantees of robustness, and reject-sampling-based generation often introduces significant distribution distortions compared with unwatermarked outputs. In this work, we introduce a new theoretical framework on SWM through the concept of proxy functions (PFs) $\unicode{x2013}$ functions that map sentences to scalar values. Building on this framework, we propose PMark, a simple yet powerful SWM method that estimates the PF median for the next sentence dynamically through sampling while enforcing multiple PF constraints (which we call channels) to strengthen watermark evidence. Equipped with solid theoretical guarantees, PMark achieves the desired distortion-free property and improves the robustness against paraphrasing-style attacks. We also provide an empirically optimized version that further removes the requirement for dynamical median estimation for better sampling efficiency. Experimental results show that PMark consistently outperforms existing SWM baselines in both text quality and robustness, offering a more effective paradigm for detecting machine-generated text. Our code will be released at [this URL](https://github.com/PMark-repo/PMark).	Computation and Language	25/09/2025

This paper challenges the prevailing hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning. Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making this reasoning process transparent by sharing the ""thinking content"" dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS."

To systematically evaluate these capabilities, we introduce two specialized benchmarks for fundamental domains where multiple instructions following is important: Many Instruction-Following Eval (ManyIFEval) for text generation with up to ten instructions, and Style-aware Mostly Basic Programming Problems (StyleMBPP) for code generation with up to six instructions. Our experiments with the created benchmarks across ten LLMs reveal that performance consistently degrades as the number of instructions increases. Furthermore, given the fact that evaluating all the possible combinations of multiple instructions is computationally impractical in actual use cases, we developed three types of regression models that can estimate performance on both unseen instruction combinations and different numbers of instructions which are not used during training. We demonstrate that a logistic regression model using instruction count as an explanatory variable can predict performance of following multiple instructions with approximately 10% error, even for unseen instruction combinations. We show that relatively modest sample sizes (500 for ManyIFEval and 300 for StyleMBPP) are sufficient for performance estimation, enabling efficient evaluation of LLMs under various instruction combinations.

Junu Kim; Xiao Liu; Zhenghao Lin; Lei Ji; Yeyun Gong; Edward Choi	While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings.

Static k-hop expansions and ""think-longer"" prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack, what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices, allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline (GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints."	Computation and Language	25/09/2025

Yiyou Sun; Yuhan Cao; Pohao Huang; Haoyue Bai; Hannaneh Hajishirzi; Nouha Dziri; Dawn Song	It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability -- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability, we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory, compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer. Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21012v1	Mechanism of Task-oriented Information Removal in In-context Learning	Hakaze Cho; Haolin Yang; Gouki Minegishi; Naoya Inoue	In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics, we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover, we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information removal mechanism and denoising heads.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20997v1	Binary Autoencoder for Mechanistic Interpretability of Large Language   Models	Hakaze Cho; Haolin Yang; Brian M. Kurkoski; Naoya Inoue	Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components (features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature extractor.

Our research investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic Text-Input Problems using rubrics. We propose five evaluation systems that have been tested on a custom dataset of 110 answers about computer science from higher education students with three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM evaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score; Reference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from the original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the reference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive Evaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each question. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human evaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and score Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square deviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation offers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other methods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results in concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to correctly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good results due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that Artificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper methodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic resources.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20977v1	CLUE: Conflict-guided Localization for LLM Unlearning Framework	Hang Chen; Jiaying Zhu; Xinyu Yang; Wenya Wang	The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned, they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions, risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and retain utility through precise neural localization.

However, research and resources for tool calling are predominantly English-centric, leaving a gap in our understanding of how to enable this functionality for other languages, such as Arabic. This paper investigates three key research questions: (1) the necessity of in-language (Arabic) tool-calling data versus relying on cross-lingual transfer, (2) the effect of general-purpose instruction tuning on tool-calling performance, and (3) the value of fine-tuning on specific, high-priority tools. To address these questions, we conduct extensive experiments using base and post-trained variants of an open-weight Arabic LLM. To enable this study, we bridge the resource gap by translating and adapting two open-source tool-calling datasets into Arabic. Our findings provide crucial insights into the optimal strategies for developing robust tool-augmented agents for Arabic.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025

Using harmonized dependency treebanks and a mixed-effects framework across multiple languages, the analysis jointly evaluates sentence length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of the Memory-load measure. Studies in Psycholinguistics have reported the contributions of feature interference and misbinding to memory load during processing. For this study, I operationalized sentence-level memory load as the linear sum of feature misbinding and feature interference for tractability; current evidence does not establish that their cognitive contributions combine additively. All three factors are positively associated with memory load, with sentence length exerting the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity offering explanatory power beyond linear distance. Conceptually, the findings reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality by treating dependency length as an important surface signature while identifying intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration and maintenance demands. Methodologically, the study illustrates how UD-based graph measures and cross-linguistic mixed-effects modelling can disentangle linear and structural contributions to processing efficiency, providing a principled path for evaluating competing theories of memory load in sentence comprehension.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20909v1	MemLens: Uncovering Memorization in LLMs with Activation Trajectories	Zirui He; Haiyan Zhao; Ali Payani; Mengnan du	Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on challenging benchmarks such as AIME and Math500, which are susceptible to contamination and risk of being memorized. Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection) to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit ``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20900v1	Learning to Summarize by Learning to Quiz: Adversarial Agentic   Collaboration for Long Document Summarization	Weixuan Wang; Minghao Wu; Barry Haddow; Alexandra Birch	Long document summarization remains a significant challenge for current large language models (LLMs), as existing approaches commonly struggle with information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues when processing excessively long documents. We propose SummQ, a novel adversarial multi-agent framework that addresses these limitations through collaborative intelligence between specialized agents operating in two complementary domains: summarization and quizzing. Our approach employs summary generators and reviewers that work collaboratively to create and evaluate comprehensive summaries, while quiz generators and reviewers create comprehension questions that serve as continuous quality checks for the summarization process. This adversarial dynamic, enhanced by an examinee agent that validates whether the generated summary contains the information needed to answer the quiz questions, enables iterative refinement through multifaceted feedback mechanisms. We evaluate SummQ on three widely used long document summarization benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, as well as in LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations. Our comprehensive analyses reveal the effectiveness of the multi-agent collaboration dynamics, the influence of different agent configurations, and the impact of the quizzing mechanism. This work establishes a new approach for long document summarization that uses adversarial agentic collaboration to improve summarization quality.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20882v1	On Theoretical Interpretations of Concept-Based In-Context Learning	Huaze Tang; Tianren Peng; Shao-lun Huang	In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as an important new paradigm in natural language processing and large language model (LLM) applications. However, the theoretical understanding of the ICL mechanism remains limited. This paper aims to investigate this issue by studying a particular ICL approach, called concept-based ICL (CB-ICL). In particular, we propose theoretical analyses on applying CB-ICL to ICL tasks, which explains why and when the CB-ICL performs well for predicting query labels in prompts with only a few demonstrations. In addition, the proposed theory quantifies the knowledge that can be leveraged by the LLMs to the prompt tasks, and leads to a similarity measure between the prompt demonstrations and the query input, which provides important insights and guidance for model pre-training and prompt engineering in ICL. Moreover, the impact of the prompt demonstration size and the dimension of the LLM embeddings in ICL are also explored based on the proposed theory. Finally, several real-data experiments are conducted to validate the practical usefulness of CB-ICL and the corresponding theory.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20868v1	StyleBench: Evaluating thinking styles in Large Language Models	Junyu Guo; Shangding Gu; Ming Jin; Costas Spanos; Javad Lavaei	The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts. However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles, including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought (AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale. Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in https://github.com/JamesJunyuGuo/Style_Bench.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20866v1	Single Answer is Not Enough: On Generating Ranked Lists with Medical   Reasoning Models	Pittawat Taveekitworachai; Natpatchara Pongjirapat; Krittaphas Chaisutyakorn; Piyalitt Ittichaiwong; Tossaporn Saengja; Kunat Pipatanakul	This paper presents a systematic study on enabling medical reasoning models (MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions. Clinical decision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple options, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are typically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We propose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches: prompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an MRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats: choice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train and evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT incentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We propose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and conduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust across multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with multiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the benchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches for enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists. We hope this work provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats that are beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20863v1	WeFT: Weighted Entropy-driven Fine-Tuning for dLLMs	Guowei Xu; Wenxin Xu; Jiawang Zhao; Kaisheng Ma	Diffusion models have recently shown strong potential in language modeling, offering faster generation compared to traditional autoregressive approaches. However, applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to diffusion models remains challenging, as they lack precise probability estimates at each denoising step. While the diffusion mechanism enables the model to reason over entire sequences, it also makes the generation process less predictable and often inconsistent. This highlights the importance of controlling key tokens that guide the direction of generation. To address this issue, we propose WeFT, a weighted SFT method for diffusion language models, where tokens are assigned different weights based on their entropy. Derived from diffusion theory, WeFT delivers substantial gains: training on s1K, s1K-1.1, and 3k samples from open-r1, it achieves relative improvements of 39%, 64%, and 83% over standard SFT on four widely used reasoning benchmarks (Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and MATH-500). The code and models will be made publicly available.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025

However, we observe two problems in the citations produced by existing attribution methods. First, the citations are typically provided at the sentence or even paragraph level. Long sentences or paragraphs may include a substantial amount of irrelevant content. Second, sentence-level citations may omit information that is essential for verifying the output, forcing users to read the surrounding context. In this paper, we propose generating sub-sentence citations that are both concise and sufficient, thereby reducing the effort required by users to confirm the correctness of the generated output. To this end, we first develop annotation guidelines for such citations and construct a corresponding dataset. Then, we propose an attribution framework for generating citations that adhere to our standards. This framework leverages LLMs to automatically generate fine-tuning data for our task and employs a credit model to filter out low-quality examples. Our experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate that the propose approach can generate high-quality and more readable citations.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025

Existing text anonymization and de-identification techniques, such as rule-based redaction and scrubbing, often struggle to balance privacy preservation with text naturalness and utility. In this work, we propose a zero-shot, tree-search-based iterative sentence rewriting algorithm that systematically obfuscates or deletes private information while preserving coherence, relevance, and naturalness. Our method incrementally rewrites privacy-sensitive segments through a structured search guided by a reward model, enabling dynamic exploration of the rewriting space. Experiments on privacy-sensitive datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving a superior balance between privacy protection and utility preservation.

While this enables scalable data creation, it introduces a previously unexplored bottleneck: the verification ceiling, in which the quality and diversity of training data are fundamentally constrained by the capabilities of synthetic verifiers. In this work, we systematically study how verification design and strategies influence model performance. We investigate (i) what we verify by analyzing the impact of test complexity and quantity: richer test suites improve code generation capabilities (on average +3 pass@1), while quantity alone yields diminishing returns, (ii) how we verify by exploring relaxed pass thresholds: rigid 100% pass criteria can be overly restrictive. By allowing for relaxed thresholds or incorporating LLM-based soft verification, we can recover valuable training data, leading to a 2-4 point improvement in pass@1 performance. However, this benefit is contingent upon the strength and diversity of the test cases used, and (iii) why verification remains necessary through controlled comparisons of formally correct versus incorrect solutions and human evaluation: retaining diverse correct solutions per problem yields consistent generalization gains. Our results show that Verification as currently practiced is too rigid, filtering out valuable diversity. But it cannot be discarded, only recalibrated. By combining calibrated verification with diverse, challenging problem-solution pairs, we outline a path to break the verification ceiling and unlock stronger code generation models.

To address this, we propose cheat-sheet ICL, which distills the information from many-shot ICL into a concise textual summary (cheat sheet) used as the context at inference time. Experiments on challenging reasoning tasks show that cheat-sheet ICL achieves comparable or better performance than many-shot ICL with far fewer tokens, and matches retrieval-based ICL without requiring test-time retrieval. These findings demonstrate that cheat-sheet ICL is a practical alternative for leveraging LLMs in downstream tasks.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20811v1	Leveraging What's Overfixed: Post-Correction via LLM Grammatical Error   Overcorrection	Taehee Park; Heejin Do; Gary Geunbae Lee	Robust supervised fine-tuned small Language Models (sLMs) often show high reliability but tend to undercorrect. They achieve high precision at the cost of low recall. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) often show the opposite tendency, making excessive overcorrection, leading to low precision. To effectively harness the strengths of LLMs to address the recall challenges in sLMs, we propose Post-Correction via Overcorrection (PoCO), a novel approach that strategically balances recall and precision. PoCO first intentionally triggers overcorrection via LLM to maximize recall by allowing comprehensive revisions, then applies a targeted post-correction step via fine-tuning smaller models to identify and refine erroneous outputs. We aim to harmonize both aspects by leveraging the generative power of LLMs while preserving the reliability of smaller supervised models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall with competitive precision, ultimately improving the overall quality of grammatical error correction.

However, they still struggle with hallucinations and factual errors in knowledge-intensive scenarios like knowledge graph question answering (KGQA). We attribute this to the semantic gap between structured knowledge graphs (KGs) and unstructured queries, caused by inherent differences in their focuses and structures. Existing methods usually employ resource-intensive, non-scalable workflows reasoning on vanilla KGs, but overlook this gap. To address this challenge, we propose a flexible framework, Enrich-on-Graph (EoG), which leverages LLMs' prior knowledge to enrich KGs, bridge the semantic gap between graphs and queries. EoG enables efficient evidence extraction from KGs for precise and robust reasoning, while ensuring low computational costs, scalability, and adaptability across different methods. Furthermore, we propose three graph quality evaluation metrics to analyze query-graph alignment in KGQA task, supported by theoretical validation of our optimization objectives. Extensive experiments on two KGQA benchmark datasets indicate that EoG can effectively generate high-quality KGs and achieve the state-of-the-art performance.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20805v1	Few-Shot and Training-Free Review Generation via Conversational   Prompting	Genki Kusano	Personalized review generation helps businesses understand user preferences, yet most existing approaches assume extensive review histories of the target user or require additional model training. Real-world applications often face few-shot and training-free situations, where only a few user reviews are available and fine-tuning is infeasible. It is well known that large language models (LLMs) can address such low-resource settings, but their effectiveness depends on prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose Conversational Prompting, a lightweight method that reformulates user reviews as multi-turn conversations. Its simple variant, Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP), relies solely on the user's own reviews, while the contrastive variant, Contrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP), inserts reviews from other users or LLMs as incorrect replies and then asks the model to correct them, encouraging the model to produce text in the user's style. Experiments on eight product domains and five LLMs showed that the conventional non-conversational prompt often produced reviews similar to those written by random users, based on text-based metrics such as ROUGE-L and BERTScore, and application-oriented tasks like user identity matching and sentiment analysis. In contrast, both SCP and CCP produced reviews much closer to those of the target user, even when each user had only two reviews. CCP brings further improvements when high-quality negative examples are available, whereas SCP remains competitive when such data cannot be collected. These results suggest that conversational prompting offers a practical solution for review generation under few-shot and training-free constraints.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20784v1	Towards Atoms of Large Language Models	Chenhui Hu; Pengfei Cao; Yubo Chen; Kang Liu; Jun Zhao	The fundamental units of internal representations in large language models (LLMs) remain undefined, limiting further understanding of their mechanisms. Neurons or features are often regarded as such units, yet neurons suffer from polysemy, while features face concerns of unreliable reconstruction and instability. To address this issue, we propose the Atoms Theory, which defines such units as atoms. We introduce the atomic inner product (AIP) to correct representation shifting, formally define atoms, and prove the conditions that atoms satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), ensuring stable sparse representations over atom set and linking to compressed sensing. Under stronger conditions, we further establish the uniqueness and exact $\ell_1$ recoverability of the sparse representations, and provide guarantees that single-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with threshold activations can reliably identify the atoms. To validate the Atoms Theory, we train threshold-activated SAEs on Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B, achieving 99.9% sparse reconstruction across layers on average, and more than 99.8% of atoms satisfy the uniqueness condition, compared to 0.5% for neurons and 68.2% for features, showing that atoms more faithfully capture intrinsic representations of LLMs. Scaling experiments further reveal the link between SAEs size and recovery capacity. Overall, this work systematically introduces and validates Atoms Theory of LLMs, providing a theoretical framework for understanding internal representations and a foundation for mechanistic interpretability.

In this work, we revisit this trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss, including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i) using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20751v1	Seeing Through Words, Speaking Through Pixels: Deep Representational   Alignment Between Vision and Language Models	Zoe Wanying He; Sean Trott; Meenakshi Khosla	"Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios, and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered (e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a forced-choice ""Pick-a-Pic"" task shows that human preferences for image-caption matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation."

C2R strategically constructs and refines sub-questions and their answers (sub-QAs), deriving a better confidence score for the target answer. C2R first curates a subset of sub-QAs to explore diverse reasoning paths, then compares the confidence scores of the resulting answer candidates to select the most reliable final answer. Since C2R relies solely on confidence scores derived from the model itself, it can be seamlessly integrated with various existing QA models, demonstrating consistent performance improvements across diverse models and benchmarks. Furthermore, we provide essential yet underexplored insights into how leveraging sub-QAs affects model behavior, specifically analyzing the impact of both the quantity and quality of sub-QAs on achieving robust and reliable reasoning.

We analyze when and how the collapse emerges across key components of neural parameterization and introduce a targeted solution, $\textit{collapse-relaxing neural parameterization}$, to mitigate it. Our approach substantially improves parsing performance while enabling the use of significantly more compact grammars across a wide range of languages, as demonstrated through extensive empirical analysis.

Rather than adjudicating truth, this study examines how credibility is packaged in nutrition and supplement videos by analyzing the intersection of authority signals, narrative techniques, and monetization. We assemble a cross platform corpus of 152 public videos from TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube and annotate each on 26 features spanning visual authority, presenter attributes, narrative strategies, and engagement cues. A transparent annotation pipeline integrates automatic speech recognition, principled frame selection, and a multimodal model, with human verification on a stratified subsample showing strong agreement. Descriptively, a confident single presenter in studio or home settings dominates, and clinical contexts are rare. Analytically, authority cues such as titles, slides and charts, and certificates frequently occur with persuasive elements including jargon, references, fear or urgency, critiques of mainstream medicine, and conspiracies, and with monetization including sales links and calls to subscribe. References and science like visuals often travel with emotive and oppositional narratives rather than signaling restraint.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025

A core challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods, such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via \textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025

However, SER in real-world deployments often fails under domain mismatch, where source data are unavailable and powerful LALMs are accessible only through an API. We ask: given only unlabeled target-domain audio and an API-only LALM, can a student model be adapted to outperform the LALM in the target domain? To this end, we propose MI-Fuse, a denoised label fusion framework that supplements the LALM with a source-domain trained SER classifier as an auxiliary teacher. The framework draws multiple stochastic predictions from both teachers, weights their mean distributions by mutual-information-based uncertainty, and stabilizes training with an exponential moving average teacher. Experiments across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show consistent gains, with the student surpassing the LALM and outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.9%. This approach strengthens emotion-aware speech systems without sharing source data, enabling realistic adaptation.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025

However, the increasing complexity of transformer-based architectures has dramatically raised the computational cost of attack testing, especially for researchers with limited resources (e.g., GPUs). Existing popular black-box attack methods often require a large number of queries, which can make them inefficient and impractical for researchers. To address these challenges, we propose two new attack selection strategies called Hybrid and Dynamic Select, which better combine the strengths of previous selection algorithms. Hybrid Select merges generalized BinarySelect techniques with GreedySelect by introducing a size threshold to decide which selection algorithm to use. Dynamic Select provides an alternative approach of combining the generalized Binary and GreedySelect by learning which lengths of texts each selection method should be applied to. This greatly reduces the number of queries needed while maintaining attack effectiveness (a limitation of BinarySelect). Across 4 datasets and 6 target models, our best method(sentence-level Hybrid Select) is able to reduce the number of required queries per attack up 25.82\% on average against both encoder models and LLMs, without losing the effectiveness of the attack.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20691v1	RedHerring Attack: Testing the Reliability of Attack Detection	Jonathan Rusert	In response to adversarial text attacks, attack detection models have been proposed and shown to successfully identify text modified by adversaries. Attack detection models can be leveraged to provide an additional check for NLP models and give signals for human input. However, the reliability of these models has not yet been thoroughly explored. Thus, we propose and test a novel attack setting and attack, RedHerring. RedHerring aims to make attack detection models unreliable by modifying a text to cause the detection model to predict an attack, while keeping the classifier correct. This creates a tension between the classifier and detector. If a human sees that the detector is giving an ``incorrect'' prediction, but the classifier a correct one, then the human will see the detector as unreliable. We test this novel threat model on 4 datasets against 3 detectors defending 4 classifiers. We find that RedHerring is able to drop detection accuracy between 20 - 71 points, while maintaining (or improving) classifier accuracy. As an initial defense, we propose a simple confidence check which requires no retraining of the classifier or detector and increases detection accuracy greatly. This novel threat model offers new insights into how adversaries may target detection models.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025

Vulnerabilities, Attacks, and Defense Evaluation	Wenkai Guo; Xuefeng Liu; Haolin Wang; Jianwei Niu; Shaojie Tang; Jing Yuan	Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains. Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers can still extract training data from the global model, even using straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL, including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20673v1	Human Semantic Representations of Social Interactions from Moving Shapes	Yiling Yun; Hongjing Lu	Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features, labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best. These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract representations.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20664v1	Enhancing Molecular Property Prediction with Knowledge from Large   Language Models	Peng Zhou; Lai Hou Tim; Zhixiang Cheng; Kun Xie; Chaoyi Li; Wei Liu; Xiangxiang Zeng	Predicting molecular properties is a critical component of drug discovery. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have enabled end-to-end learning from molecular structures, reducing reliance on manual feature engineering. However, while GNNs and self-supervised learning approaches have advanced molecular property prediction (MPP), the integration of human prior knowledge remains indispensable, as evidenced by recent methods that leverage large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction. Despite their strengths, LLMs are constrained by knowledge gaps and hallucinations, particularly for less-studied molecular properties. In this work, we propose a novel framework that, for the first time, integrates knowledge extracted from LLMs with structural features derived from pre-trained molecular models to enhance MPP. Our approach prompts LLMs to generate both domain-relevant knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, producing knowledge-based features that are subsequently fused with structural representations. We employ three state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and DeepSeek-R1, for knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our integrated method outperforms existing approaches, confirming that the combination of LLM-derived knowledge and structural information provides a robust and effective solution for MPP.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20655v1	Building Tailored Speech Recognizers for Japanese Speaking Assessment	Yotaro Kubo; Richard Sproat; Chihiro Taguchi; Llion Jones	This paper presents methods for building speech recognizers tailored for Japanese speaking assessment tasks. Specifically, we build a speech recognizer that outputs phonemic labels with accent markers. Although Japanese is resource-rich, there is only a small amount of data for training models to produce accurate phonemic transcriptions that include accent marks. We propose two methods to mitigate data sparsity. First, a multitask training scheme introduces auxiliary loss functions to estimate orthographic text labels and pitch patterns of the input signal, so that utterances with only orthographic annotations can be leveraged in training. The second fuses two estimators, one over phonetic alphabet strings, and the other over text token sequences. To combine these estimates we develop an algorithm based on the finite-state transducer framework. Our results indicate that the use of multitask learning and fusion is effective for building an accurate phonemic recognizer. We show that this approach is advantageous compared to the use of generic multilingual recognizers. The relative advantages of the proposed methods were also compared. Our proposed methods reduced the average of mora-label error rates from 12.3% to 7.1% over the CSJ core evaluation sets.	Computation and Language	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20645v1	Look Before you Leap: Estimating LLM Benchmark Scores from Descriptions	Jungsoo Park; Ethan Mendes; Gabriel Stanovsky; Alan Ritter	Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck: build a benchmark, evaluate models and settings, then iterate. We therefore ask a simple question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments? We study text-only performance forecasting: estimating a model's score from a redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics. Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: models equipped with a retrieval module that excludes source papers achieve moderate prediction performance with well-calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as low as 8.7 on the Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds. Our analysis indicates that stronger reasoning models engage in diverse, iterative querying, whereas current open-source models lag and often skip retrieval or gather evidence with limited diversity. We further test a zero-leakage setting, forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are indexed, where GPT-5 with built-in web search still attains nontrivial prediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step toward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and smarter experiment prioritization.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20624v1	FS-DFM: Fast and Accurate Long Text Generation with Few-Step Diffusion   Language Models	Amin Karimi Monsefi; Nikhil Bhendawade; Manuel Rafael Ciosici; Dominic Culver; Yizhe Zhang; Irina Belousova	Autoregressive language models (ARMs) deliver strong likelihoods, but are inherently serial: they generate one token per forward pass, which limits throughput and inflates latency for long sequences. Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) parallelize across positions and thus appear promising for language generation, yet standard discrete diffusion typically needs hundreds to thousands of model evaluations to reach high quality, trading serial depth for iterative breadth. We introduce FS-DFM, Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching. A discrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality. The core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit parameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big move lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update rule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and with strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together, these choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On language modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity parity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens using a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and corresponding latency/throughput gains.

Current automatic detection methods often lack explainability and robustness in detecting new phishing attacks. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of character-level deep learning models for phishing detection, which can provide both robustness and interpretability. We evaluate three neural architectures adapted to operate at the character level, namely CharCNN, CharGRU, and CharBiLSTM, on a custom-built email dataset, which combines data from multiple sources. Their performance is analyzed under three scenarios: (i) standard training and testing, (ii) standard training and testing under adversarial attacks, and (iii) training and testing with adversarial examples. Aiming to develop a tool that operates as a browser extension, we test all models under limited computational resources. In this constrained setup, CharGRU proves to be the best-performing model across all scenarios. All models show vulnerability to adversarial attacks, but adversarial training substantially improves their robustness. In addition, by adapting the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique to character-level inputs, we are able to visualize which parts of each email influence the decision of each model. Our open-source code and data is released at https://github.com/chipermaria/every-character-counts.	Computation and Language	24/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20581v1	Hierarchical Resolution Transformers: A Wavelet-Inspired Architecture   for Multi-Scale Language Understanding	Ayan Sar; Sampurna Roy; Kanav Gupta; Anurag Kaushish; Tanupriya Choudhury; Abhijit Kumar	Transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance across natural language tasks, yet they fundamentally misrepresent the hierarchical nature of human language by processing text as flat token sequences. This results in quadratic computational cost, weak computational cost, weak compositional generalization, and inadequate discourse-level modeling. We propose Hierarchical Resolution Transformer (HRT), a novel wavelet-inspired neural architecture that processes language simultaneously across multiple resolutions, from characters to discourse-level units. HRT constructs a multi-resolution attention, enabling bottom-up composition and top-down contextualization. By employing exponential sequence reduction across scales, HRT achieves O(nlogn) complexity, offering significant efficiency improvements over standard transformers. We evaluated HRT on a diverse suite of benchmarks, including GLUE, SuperGLUE, Long Range Arena, and WikiText-103, and results demonstrated that HRT outperforms standard transformer baselines by an average of +3.8% on GLUE, +4.5% on SuperGLUE, and +6.1% on Long Range Arena, while reducing memory usage by 42% and inference latency by 37% compared to BERT and GPT style models of similar parameter count. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of cross-resolution attention and scale-specialized modules, showing that each contributes independently to both efficiency and accuracy. Our findings establish HRT as the first architecture to align computational structure with the hierarchical organization of human language, demonstrating that multi-scale, wavelet-inspired processing yields both theoretical efficiency gains and practical improvements in language understanding.

Simple factual queries are subjected to the same multilayered computation as complex logical problems, wasting resources while constraining deep inference. To overcome this, we came up with a concept of Dynamic Reasoning Chains through Depth Specialised Mixture of Experts (DS-MoE), a modular framework that extends the Mixture of Experts paradigm from width-based to depth specialised computation. DS-MoE introduces expert modules optimised for distinct reasoning depths, shallow pattern recognition, compositional reasoning, logical inference, memory integration, and meta-cognitive supervision. A learned routing network dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains, activating only the necessary experts to match input complexity. The dataset on which we trained and evaluated DS-MoE is on The Pile, an 800GB corpus covering diverse domains such as scientific papers, legal texts, programming code, and web content, enabling systematic assessment across reasoning depths. Experimental results demonstrate that DS-MoE achieves up to 16 per cent computational savings and 35 per cent faster inference compared to uniform-depth transformers, while delivering 2.8 per cent higher accuracy on complex multi-step reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, routing decisions yield interpretable reasoning chains, enhancing transparency and scalability. These findings establish DS-MoE as a significant advancement in adaptive neural architectures, demonstrating that depth-specialised modular processing can simultaneously improve efficiency, reasoning quality, and interpretability in large-scale language models.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20567v1	SwasthLLM: a Unified Cross-Lingual, Multi-Task, and Meta-Learning   Zero-Shot Framework for Medical Diagnosis Using Contrastive Representations	Ayan Sar; Pranav Singh Puri; Sumit Aich; Tanupriya Choudhury; Abhijit Kumar	In multilingual healthcare environments, automatic disease diagnosis from clinical text remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of annotated medical data in low-resource languages and the linguistic variability across populations. This paper proposes SwasthLLM, a unified, zero-shot, cross-lingual, and multi-task learning framework for medical diagnosis that operates effectively across English, Hindi, and Bengali without requiring language-specific fine-tuning. At its core, SwasthLLM leverages the multilingual XLM-RoBERTa encoder augmented with a language-aware attention mechanism and a disease classification head, enabling the model to extract medically relevant information regardless of the language structure. To align semantic representations across languages, a Siamese contrastive learning module is introduced, ensuring that equivalent medical texts in different languages produce similar embeddings. Further, a translation consistency module and a contrastive projection head reinforce language-invariant representation learning. SwasthLLM is trained using a multi-task learning strategy, jointly optimizing disease classification, translation alignment, and contrastive learning objectives. Additionally, we employ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to equip the model with rapid adaptation capabilities for unseen languages or tasks with minimal data. Our phased training pipeline emphasizes robust representation alignment before task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive evaluation shows that SwasthLLM achieves high diagnostic performance, with a test accuracy of 97.22% and an F1-score of 97.17% in supervised settings. Crucially, in zero-shot scenarios, it attains 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and 73.33% accuracy on Bengali medical text, demonstrating strong generalization in low-resource contexts.

In this paper, we introduce SiniticMTError, a novel dataset that builds on existing parallel corpora to provide error span, error type, and error severity annotations in machine-translated examples from English to Mandarin, Cantonese, and Wu Chinese. Our dataset serves as a resource for the MT community to utilize in fine-tuning models with error detection capabilities, supporting research on translation quality estimation, error-aware generation, and low-resource language evaluation. We report our rigorous annotation process by native speakers, with analyses on inter-annotator agreement, iterative feedback, and patterns in error type and severity.

However, how users can effectively control, steer, and critically evaluate collaboration among multiple domain-expert agents remains underexplored. We present Perspectra, an interactive MAS that visualizes and structures deliberation among LLM agents via a forum-style interface, supporting @-mention to invite targeted agents, threading for parallel exploration, with a real-time mind map for visualizing arguments and rationales. In a within-subjects study with 18 participants, we compared Perspectra to a group-chat baseline as they developed research proposals. Our findings show that Perspectra significantly increased the frequency and depth of critical-thinking behaviors, elicited more interdisciplinary replies, and led to more frequent proposal revisions than the group chat condition. We discuss implications for designing multi-agent tools that scaffold critical thinking by supporting user control over multi-agent adversarial discourse.	Computation and Language	24/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20502v1	MARS: toward more efficient multi-agent collaboration for LLM reasoning	Xiao Wang; Jia Wang; Yijie Wang; Pengtao Dang; Sha Cao; Chi Zhang	Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in natural language understanding, yet their reasoning capabilities remain limited when operating as single agents. Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has been proposed to address this limitation by enabling collaborative reasoning among multiple models in a round-table debate manner. While effective, MAD introduces substantial computational overhead due to the number of agents involved and the frequent communication required. In this paper, we propose MARS (Multi-Agent Review System), a role-based collaboration framework inspired by the review process. In MARS, an author agent generates an initial solution, reviewer agents provide decisions and comments independently, and a meta-reviewer integrates the feedback to make the final decision and guide further revision. This design enhances reasoning quality while avoiding costly reviewer-to-reviewer interactions, thereby controlling token consumption and inference time. We compared MARS with both MAD and other state-of-the-art reasoning strategies across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments with different LLMs show that MARS matches the accuracy of MAD while reducing both token usage and inference time by approximately 50\%.

Nevertheless, for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation, prevailing methods remain limited: (i) reasoning is frequently neither clinically interpretable nor aligned with guidelines, reflecting mere aggregation of tool outputs; (ii) multimodal evidence is insufficiently fused, yielding text-only rationales that are not visually grounded; and (iii) systems rarely detect or resolve cross-tool inconsistencies and provide no principled verification mechanisms. To bridge the above gaps, we present RadAgents, a multi-agent framework for CXR interpretation that couples clinical priors with task-aware multimodal reasoning. In addition, we integrate grounding and multimodal retrieval-augmentation to verify and resolve context conflicts, resulting in outputs that are more reliable, transparent, and consistent with clinical practice.

Cresswell	Automatic summarization systems have advanced rapidly with large language models (LLMs), yet they still lack reliable guarantees on inclusion of critical content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance. In this work, we introduce Conformal Importance Summarization, the first framework for importance-preserving summary generation which uses conformal prediction to provide rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees. By calibrating thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, we enable extractive document summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical content. Our method is model-agnostic, requires only a small calibration set, and seamlessly integrates with existing black-box LLMs. Experiments on established summarization benchmarks demonstrate that Conformal Importance Summarization achieves the theoretically assured information coverage rate. Our work suggests that Conformal Importance Summarization can be combined with existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization, paving the way for safer deployment of AI summarization tools in critical applications.

However, RLVR leads to limited generalization for open-ended tasks -- such as writing outline essays or making meal plans -- where humans reason routinely. This paper shows that the RLVR paradigm is effective beyond verifiable domains, and introduces **RL** with **M**odel-rewarded **T**hinking (**RLMT**) for general-purpose chat capabilities. Using diverse real-world prompts, RLMT requires LMs to generate long CoT reasoning before response, and optimizes them with online RL against a preference-based reward model used in RLHF. Across 40 training runs on Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B (both base and instruct) and multiple optimization algorithms (DPO, PPO, and GRPO), RLMT consistently outperforms standard RLHF pipelines. This includes substantial gains of 3-7 points on three chat benchmarks (AlpacaEval2, WildBench, and ArenaHardV2), along with 1-3 point improvements on other tasks like creative writing and general knowledge. Our best 8B model surpasses GPT-4o in chat and creative writing and rivals Claude-3.7-Sonnet (Thinking). RLMT can also be applied directly to base models without an SFT stage, akin to R1-Zero training. Remarkably, with only 7K prompts, Llama-3.1-8B base trained with our RLMT recipe outperforms Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct post-trained with a complex multi-staged pipeline with 25M+ examples. We close with qualitative and quantitative analyses of how trained models plan their responses. Our results rethink the post-training pipeline and call upon future work to understand and employ thinking more broadly.	Computation and Language	24/09/2025

Our innovative training recipe strategically captures knowledge from larger models via encoder-decoder initialization and geometric embedding distillation. We improve model robustness and expressiveness with a spread-out regularizer, and ensure generalizability by merging checkpoints from varied, optimized mixtures. Evaluated on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) across multilingual, English, and code domains, EmbeddingGemma (300M) achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, it outperforms prior top models, both proprietary and open, with fewer than 500M parameters, and provides performance comparable to models double its size, offering an exceptional performance-to-cost ratio. Remarkably, this lead persists when quantizing model weights or truncating embedding outputs. This makes EmbeddingGemma particularly well-suited for low-latency and high-throughput use cases such as on-device applications. We provide ablation studies exploring our key design choices. We release EmbeddingGemma to the community to promote further research.	Computation and Language	24/09/2025

It serves as the script for numerous languages, including Tigrinya and Amharic, and played a pivotal role in Ethiopia's cultural and religious development during the Aksumite kingdom era. Ge'ez remains significant as a liturgical language in Ethiopia and Eritrea, with much of the national identity documentation recorded in Ge'ez. These written materials are invaluable primary sources for studying Ethiopian and Eritrean philosophy, creativity, knowledge, and civilization. Ge'ez has a complex morphological structure with rich inflectional and derivational morphology, and no usable NLP has been developed and published until now due to the scarcity of annotated linguistic data, corpora, labeled datasets, and lexicons. Therefore, we propose a rule-based Ge'ez morphological synthesizer to generate surface words from root words according to the morphological structures of the language. We used 1,102 sample verbs, representing all verb morphological structures, to test and evaluate the system. The system achieves a performance of 97.4%, outperforming the baseline model and suggesting that future work should build a comprehensive system considering morphological variations of the language.

DRES builds on human-annotated Switchboard transcripts, isolating disfluency removal from ASR errors and acoustic variability. We systematically evaluate proprietary and open-source LLMs across scales, prompting strategies, and architectures. Our results reveal that (i) simple segmentation consistently improves performance, even for long-context models; (ii) reasoning-oriented models tend to over-delete fluent tokens; and (iii) fine-tuning achieves near state-of-the-art precision and recall but harms generalization abilities.

Traditional word-based metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 (E-Scores) capture overall performance but cannot reveal why models succeed or fail. We introduce Z-Scores, a span-level linguistically-grounded evaluation metric that categorizes system behavior across distinct disfluency types (EDITED, INTJ, PRN). Our deterministic alignment module enables robust mapping between generated text and disfluent transcripts, allowing Z-Scores to expose systematic weaknesses that word-level metrics obscure. By providing category-specific diagnostics, Z-Scores enable researchers to identify model failure modes and design targeted interventions -- such as tailored prompts or data augmentation -- yielding measurable performance improvements. A case study with LLMs shows that Z-Scores uncover challenges with INTJ and PRN disfluencies hidden in aggregate F1, directly informing model refinement strategies.

We identify a core latent instability issue when scaling the computational budget of implicit CoT: as the number of reasoning tokens increases, training often becomes unstable and collapses. Our analysis shows that this instability arises from latent representations becoming homogeneous and losing semantic diversity, caused by insufficient step-level supervision in current implicit CoT methods. To address this, we propose SIM-CoT, a plug-and-play training module that introduces step-level supervision to stabilize and enrich the latent reasoning space. SIM-CoT employs an auxiliary decoder during training to align each implicit token with its corresponding explicit reasoning step, ensuring latent states capture distinct and meaningful information. The auxiliary decoder is removed at inference, preserving the efficiency of implicit CoT with no added overhead. It also provides interpretability by projecting each latent token onto an explicit reasoning vocabulary, enabling per-step visualization and diagnosis. SIM-CoT significantly improves both in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain stability of implicit CoT methods, boosting Coconut by +8.2\% on GPT-2 and CODI by +3.0\% on LLaMA-3.1 8B. It further surpasses the explicit CoT baseline on GPT-2 by 2.1\% with 2.3$\times$ greater token efficiency, while closing the performance gap on larger models like LLaMA-3.1 8B.

However, its detection remains challenging, especially in multilingual and low-resource settings. This paper presents a multilingual framework for hope speech detection using an active learning approach and transformer-based models, including mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa. Experiments were conducted on datasets in English, Spanish, German, and Urdu, including benchmark test sets from recent shared tasks. Our results show that transformer models significantly outperform traditional baselines, with XLM-RoBERTa achieving the highest overall accuracy. Furthermore, our active learning strategy maintained strong performance even with small annotated datasets. This study highlights the effectiveness of combining multilingual transformers with data-efficient training strategies for hope speech detection.	Computation and Language	24/09/2025

Adequacy-Fluency Tradeoffs in   Evaluation and Meta-Evaluation of Machine Translation	Behzad Shayegh; Jan-Thorsten Peter; David Vilar; Tobias Domhan; Juraj Juraska; Markus Freitag; Lili Mou	We investigate the tradeoff between adequacy and fluency in machine translation. We show the severity of this tradeoff at the evaluation level and analyze where popular metrics fall within it. Essentially, current metrics generally lean toward adequacy, meaning that their scores correlate more strongly with the adequacy of translations than with fluency. More importantly, we find that this tradeoff also persists at the meta-evaluation level, and that the standard WMT meta-evaluation favors adequacy-oriented metrics over fluency-oriented ones. We show that this bias is partially attributed to the composition of the systems included in the meta-evaluation datasets. To control this bias, we propose a method that synthesizes translation systems in meta-evaluation. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding this tradeoff in meta-evaluation and its impact on metric rankings.	Computation and Language	24/09/2025

However, their limitations - especially those stemming from prompt design - remain underexplored. Because users may supply biased or incomplete prompts - often unintentionally - LLMs can be misled, undermining reliability and creating risks. We refer to this vulnerability as the Instruction Boundary. To investigate the phenomenon, we distill it into eight concrete facets and introduce BiasDetector, a framework that measures biases arising from three instruction types: complete, redundant, and insufficient. We evaluate several mainstream LLMs and find that, despite high headline accuracy, substantial biases persist in many downstream tasks as a direct consequence of prompt coverage. Our empirical study confirms that LLM reasoning reliability can still be significantly improved. We analyze the practical impact of these biases and outline mitigation strategies. Our findings underscore the need for developers to tackle biases and for users to craft options carefully.	Computation and Language	24/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20270v1	Scan-do Attitude: Towards Autonomous CT Protocol Management using a   Large Language Model Agent	Xingjian Kang; Linda Vorberg; Andreas Maier; Alexander Katzmann; Oliver Taubmann	Managing scan protocols in Computed Tomography (CT), which includes adjusting acquisition parameters or configuring reconstructions, as well as selecting postprocessing tools in a patient-specific manner, is time-consuming and requires clinical as well as technical expertise. At the same time, we observe an increasing shortage of skilled workforce in radiology. To address this issue, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent framework is proposed to assist with the interpretation and execution of protocol configuration requests given in natural language or a structured, device-independent format, aiming to improve the workflow efficiency and reduce technologists' workload. The agent combines in-context-learning, instruction-following, and structured toolcalling abilities to identify relevant protocol elements and apply accurate modifications. In a systematic evaluation, experimental results indicate that the agent can effectively retrieve protocol components, generate device compatible protocol definition files, and faithfully implement user requests. Despite demonstrating feasibility in principle, the approach faces limitations regarding syntactic and semantic validity due to lack of a unified device API, and challenges with ambiguous or complex requests. In summary, the findings show a clear path towards LLM-based agents for supporting scan protocol management in CT imaging.	Computation and Language	24/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20265v1	Failure Modes of Maximum Entropy RLHF	Ömer Veysel Çağatan; Barış Akgün	In this paper, we show that Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) can be derived as Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning with length-normalized temperature, providing a theoretical foundation for this reference-free method. Motivated by SimPO's strong performance in offline preference optimization, we investigate whether Maximum Entropy RL can achieve similar results in online RLHF settings. Our experiments find that Maximum Entropy RL consistently exhibits overoptimization and unstable KL dynamics, even at very low learning rates. Unlike KL-constrained methods that maintain stable training, entropy regularization fails to prevent reward hacking and appears to correlate with overoptimization. Lastly, we discuss possible explanations for why SimPO succeeds in offline settings while Maximum Entropy RL struggles in online scenarios. Our findings suggest that reference-free approaches may face distinct challenges when applied to online or offline preference learning.	Computation and Language	24/09/2025

Our work studies the representation of them in language models using three fine-tuning strategies. The models are trained on three dialogue corpora in English and Japanese, where backchannels and fillers are preserved and annotated, to investigate how fine-tuning can help LMs learn their representations. We first apply clustering analysis to the learnt representation of backchannels and fillers, and have found increased silhouette scores in representations from fine-tuned models, which suggests that fine-tuning enables LMs to distinguish the nuanced semantic variation in different backchannel and filler use. We also use natural language generation (NLG) metrics to confirm that the utterances generated by fine-tuned language models resemble human-produced utterances more closely. Our findings suggest the potentials of transforming general LMs into conversational LMs that are more capable of producing human-like languages adequately.	Computation and Language	24/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20228v1	Muse-it: A Tool for Analyzing Music Discourse on Reddit	Jatin Agarwala; George Paul; Nemani Harsha Vardhan; Vinoo Alluri	Music engagement spans diverse interactions with music, from selection and emotional response to its impact on behavior, identity, and social connections. Social media platforms provide spaces where such engagement can be observed in natural, unprompted conversations. Advances in natural language processing (NLP) and big data analytics make it possible to analyze these discussions at scale, extending music research to broader contexts. Reddit, in particular, offers anonymity that encourages diverse participation and yields rich discourse on music in ecological settings. Yet the scale of this data requires tools to extract, process, and analyze it effectively. We present Muse-it, a platform that retrieves comprehensive Reddit data centered on user-defined queries. It aggregates posts from across subreddits, supports topic modeling, temporal trend analysis, and clustering, and enables efficient study of large-scale discourse. Muse-it also identifies music-related hyperlinks (e.g., Spotify), retrieves track-level metadata such as artist, album, release date, genre, popularity, and lyrics, and links these to the discussions. An interactive interface provides dynamic visualizations of the collected data. Muse-it thus offers an accessible way for music researchers to gather and analyze big data, opening new avenues for understanding music engagement as it naturally unfolds online.

We introduce two key innovations: ""timestep sharing"" to reduce gradient noise and ""split-timestep fine-tuning"" to improve prompt alignment. Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.

Chan	A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances, state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis with precise parameter control.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.21302v1	Quantized Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer	Weilun Feng; Haotong Qin; Mingqiang Wu; Chuanguang Yang; Yuqi Li; Xiangqi Li; Zhulin An; Libo Huang; Yulun Zhang; Michele Magno; Yongjun Xu	Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and 2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in https://github.com/wlfeng0509/QuantVGGT.

However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically, considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video dataset collection. Project page: https://allenyidan.github.io/vcagent_page/.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21278v1	Does FLUX Already Know How to Perform Physically Plausible Image   Composition?	Shilin Lu; Zhuming Lian; Zihan Zhou; Shaocong Zhang; Chen Zhao; Adams Wai-Kin Kong	Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g., DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward). Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	25/09/2025

In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role in global climate processes.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21268v1	MMR1: Enhancing Multimodal Reasoning with Variance-Aware Sampling and   Open Resources	Sicong Leng; Jing Wang; Jiaxi Li; Hao Zhang; Zhiqiang Hu; Boqiang Zhang; Yuming Jiang; Hang Zhang; Xin Li; Lidong Bing; Deli Zhao; Wei Lu; Yu Rong; Aixin Sun; Shijian Lu	Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open, large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty, and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase. (3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales, establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition, we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize this guarantee.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21265v1	MedVSR: Medical Video Super-Resolution with Cross State-Space   Propagation	Xinyu Liu; Guolei Sun; Cheng Wang; Yixuan Yuan; Ender Konukoglu	High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints. Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake, noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models, enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in reconstruction performance and efficiency.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21263v1	Dense Semantic Matching with VGGT Prior	Songlin Yang; Tianyi Wei; Yushi Lan; Zeqi Xiao; Anyi Rao; Xingang Pan	Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance, misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages, fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation, outperforming previous baselines.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21261v1	Every Subtlety Counts: Fine-grained Person Independence Micro-Action   Recognition via Distributionally Robust Optimization	Feng-Qi Cui; Jinyang Huang; Anyang Tong; Ziyu Jia; Jie Zhang; Zhi Liu; Dan Guo; Jianwei Lu; Meng Wang	Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under fine-grained conditions.

While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations. This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	25/09/2025

However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs. To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP, which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture. Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate reasoning than the previous works.

While foundation models have revolutionized natural language and vision tasks, their application to MRI remains limited due to data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus. In this work, we present Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language foundation model trained on a large-scale dataset comprising 200,000 MRI series from over 22,000 studies spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen pretrained encoder. Following this setting, we evaluate Decipher-MR across diverse benchmarks including disease classification, demographic prediction, anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating consistent performance gains over existing foundation models and task-specific approaches. Our results establish Decipher-MR as a scalable and versatile foundation for MRI-based AI, facilitating efficient development across clinical and research domains.

Yang; Dipkamal Bhusal; Nidhi Rastogi	"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently ""cheat"" by exploiting superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization. However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST, show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST, demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model attention that better reflects human intuition."

However, most methods still rely primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained, controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images, Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry, topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production workflows.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21239v1	SlideMamba: Entropy-Based Adaptive Fusion of GNN and Mamba for Enhanced   Representation Learning in Digital Pathology	Shakib Khan; Fariba Dambandkhameneh; Nazim Shaikh; Yao Nie; Raghavan Venugopal; Xiao Li	Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies, offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the contextual importance of local versus global information for different downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve (PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39 \pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm 0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21227v1	Evaluating the Evaluators: Metrics for Compositional Text-to-Image   Generation	Seyed Amir Kasaei; Ali Aghayari; Arash Marioriyad; Niki Sepasian; MohammadAmin Fazli; Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah; Mohammad Hossein Rohban	Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation. Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment. These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models in generation.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21223v1	Sigma: Semantically Informative Pre-training for Skeleton-based Sign   Language Understanding	Muxin Pu; Mei Kuan Lim; Chun Yong Chong; Chen Change Loy	Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance between local details and global context, with models either focusing too narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3) inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises agreements across different levels of paired features from different modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution for SLU.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21209v1	Learning Conformal Explainers for Image Classifiers	Amr Alkhatib; Stephanie Lowry	Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions. The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions. Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.21205v1	TABLET: A Large-Scale Dataset for Robust Visual Table Understanding	Iñigo Alonso; Imanol Miranda; Eneko Agirre; Mirella Lapata	While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4 million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88% preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21196v1	Differential-Integral Neural Operator for Long-Term Turbulence   Forecasting	Hao Wu; Yuan Gao; Fan Xu; Fan Zhang; Qingsong Wen; Kun Wang; Xiaomeng Huang; Xian Wu	Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods, particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics: local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper, we propose the {\textbf{\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\textbf{\underline{I}}}ntegral {\textbf{\underline{N}}}eural {\textbf{\underline{O}}}perator (\method{}), a novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator decomposition. \method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This physics-based decomposition endows \method{} with exceptional stability and robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow benchmark, we demonstrate that \method{} significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.

Zhai; Shenlong Wang	When navigating in a man-made environment they haven't visited before--like an office building--humans employ behaviors such as reading signs and asking others for directions. These behaviors help humans reach their destinations efficiently by reducing the need to search through large areas. Existing robot navigation systems lack the ability to execute such behaviors and are thus highly inefficient at navigating within large environments. We present ReasonNav, a modular navigation system which integrates these human-like navigation skills by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of a vision-language model (VLM). We design compact input and output abstractions based on navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and reasoning. We evaluate ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks and show that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate efficiently in large, complex buildings.

A Systematic Evaluation of   Quantization's Impact on CLIP Beyond Accuracy	Aymen Bouguerra; Daniel Montoya; Alexandra Gomez-Villa; Fabio Arnez; Chokri Mraidha	The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants. Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable, and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21167v1	A Unified Framework for Diffusion Model Unlearning with f-Divergence	Nicola Novello; Federico Fontana; Luigi Cinque; Deniz Gunduz; Andrea M. Tonello	Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model. While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities, existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences, that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21153v1	WAVECLIP: Wavelet Tokenization for Adaptive-Resolution CLIP	Moshe Kimhi; Erez Koifman; Ehud Rivlin; Eli Schwartz; Chaim Baskin	We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21135v1	The Unwinnable Arms Race of AI Image Detection	Till Aczel; Lorenzo Vettor; Andreas Plesner; Roger Wattenhofer	The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21130v1	Sparse Representations Improve Adversarial Robustness of Neural Network   Classifiers	Killian Steunou; Sigurd Saue; Théo Druilhe	Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink, where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity. Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together, the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the linear setting.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21119v1	MotionFlow:Learning Implicit Motion Flow for Complex Camera Trajectory   Control in Video Generation	Guojun Lei; Chi Wang; Yikai Wang; Hong Li; Ying Song; Weiwei Xu	Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	25/09/2025

While traditional hair modeling methods focus on realistic hair using strand-based or volumetric representations, anime hairstyle exhibits highly stylized, piecewise-structured geometry that challenges existing techniques. Existing works often rely on dense mesh modeling or hand-crafted spline curves, making them inefficient for editing and unsuitable for scalable learning. CHARM introduces a compact, invertible control-point-based parameterization, where a sequence of control points represents each hair card, and each point is encoded with only five geometric parameters. This efficient and accurate representation supports both artist-friendly design and learning-based generation. Built upon this representation, CHARM introduces an autoregressive generative framework that effectively generates anime hairstyles from input images or point clouds. By interpreting anime hairstyles as a sequential ""hair language"", our autoregressive transformer captures both local geometry and global hairstyle topology, resulting in high-fidelity anime hairstyle creation. To facilitate both training and evaluation of anime hairstyle generation, we construct AnimeHair, a large-scale dataset of 37K high-quality anime hairstyles with separated hair cards and processed mesh data. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of CHARM in both reconstruction accuracy and generation quality, offering an expressive and scalable solution for anime hairstyle modeling.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21113v1	MOSS-ChatV: Reinforcement Learning with Process Reasoning Reward for   Video Temporal Reasoning	Sicheng Tao; Jungang Li; Yibo Yan; Junyan Zhang; Yubo Gao; Hanqian Li; ShuHang Xun; Yuxuan Fan; Hong Chen; Jianxiang He; Xuming Hu	Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct, undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation. MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2, confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.21107v1	Cross-Modal Instructions for Robot Motion Generation	William Barron; Xiaoxiang Dong; Matthew Johnson-Roberson; Weiming Zhi	Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot. While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm, Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via reinforcement learning.

While previous work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a ""dissector,"" our approach labels neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists' workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories (e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g., density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept learning.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21100v1	VideoChat-R1.5: Visual Test-Time Scaling to Reinforce Multimodal   Reasoning by Iterative Perception	Ziang Yan; Xinhao Li; Yinan He; Zhengrong Yue; Xiangyu Zeng; Yali Wang; Yu Qiao; Limin Wang; Yi Wang	Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP) mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal perception.

Specifically, in terms of spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual fidelity and editability.

Hübner; Nikos Deligiannis; Marijke Vandewal; Geert De Cubber	The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks, particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs. non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT) technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97% (facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs, with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model resilience to adversarial attacks.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21061v1	EnGraf-Net: Multiple Granularity Branch Network with Fine-Coarse Graft   Grained for Classification Task	Riccardo La Grassa; Ignazio Gallo; Nicola Landro	Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual annotations.

While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward, label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging, and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting strategies are most prone to bias.

To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity. As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD detection and near OOD detection setting.

Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition. Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements. We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud. Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry, laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species and sensor modality.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.21027v1	KeyWorld: Key Frame Reasoning Enables Effective and Efficient World   Models	Sibo Li; Qianyue Hao; Yu Shang; Yong Li	Robotic world models are a promising paradigm for forecasting future environment states, yet their inference speed and the physical plausibility of generated trajectories remain critical bottlenecks, limiting their real-world applications. This stems from the redundancy of the prevailing frame-to-frame generation approach, where the model conducts costly computation on similar frames, as well as neglecting the semantic importance of key transitions. To address this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves text-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating transformers computation on a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model to fill the intermediate frames. Specifically, KeyWorld first identifies significant transitions by iteratively simplifying the robot's motion trajectories, obtaining the ground truth key frames. Then, a DiT model is trained to reason and generate these physically meaningful key frames from textual task descriptions. Finally, a lightweight interpolator efficiently reconstructs the full video by inpainting all intermediate frames. Evaluations on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that KeyWorld achieves a 5.68$\times$ acceleration compared to the frame-to-frame generation baseline, and focusing on the motion-aware key frames further contributes to the physical validity of the generated videos, especially on complex tasks. Our approach highlights a practical path toward deploying world models in real-time robotic control and other domains requiring both efficient and effective world models.

In this paper, we propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly outperforming existing methods.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.21007v1	Marching Neurons: Accurate Surface Extraction for Neural Implicit Shapes	Christian Stippel; Felix Mujkanovic; Thomas Leimkühler; Pedro Hermosilla	Accurate surface geometry representation is crucial in 3D visual computing. Explicit representations, such as polygonal meshes, and implicit representations, like signed distance functions, each have distinct advantages, making efficient conversions between them increasingly important. Conventional surface extraction methods for implicit representations, such as the widely used Marching Cubes algorithm, rely on spatial decomposition and sampling, leading to inaccuracies due to fixed and limited resolution. We introduce a novel approach for analytically extracting surfaces from neural implicit functions. Our method operates natively in parallel and can navigate large neural architectures. By leveraging the fact that each neuron partitions the domain, we develop a depth-first traversal strategy to efficiently track the encoded surface. The resulting meshes faithfully capture the full geometric information from the network without ad-hoc spatial discretization, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse shapes and network architectures while maintaining competitive speed.

In this work, we propose Fast-SEnSeI, a lightweight, sensor-independent encoder module that enables flexible, on-board cloud segmentation across multispectral sensors with varying band configurations. Building upon SEnSeI-v2, Fast-SEnSeI integrates an improved spectral descriptor, lightweight architecture, and robust padding-band handling. It accepts arbitrary combinations of spectral bands and their wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact, quantized segmentation model based on a modified U-Net. The module runs efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for space-qualified hardware. Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets demonstrate accurate segmentation across diverse input configurations.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	25/09/2025

When knowledge distillation transfers these features to students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20976v1	An Adaptor for Triggering Semi-Supervised Learning to Out-of-Box Serve   Deep Image Clustering	Yue Duan; Lei Qi; Yinghuan Shi; Yang Gao	Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining, clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image clustering methods.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20961v1	Unlocking Financial Insights: An advanced Multimodal Summarization with   Multimodal Output Framework for Financial Advisory Videos	Sarmistha Das; R E Zera Marveen Lyngkhoi; Sriparna Saha; Alka Maurya	The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy, multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER (Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3) aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By establishing a new standard for multimodal summarization, FASTER makes financial advisory content more accessible and actionable, thereby opening new avenues for research.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20946v1	A Real-Time On-Device Defect Detection Framework for Laser Power-Meter   Sensors via Unsupervised Learning	Dongqi Zheng; Wenjin Fu; Guangzong Chen	We present an automated vision-based system for defect detection and classification of laser power meter sensor coatings. Our approach addresses the critical challenge of identifying coating defects such as thermal damage and scratches that can compromise laser energy measurement accuracy in medical and industrial applications. The system employs an unsupervised anomaly detection framework that trains exclusively on ``good'' sensor images to learn normal coating distribution patterns, enabling detection of both known and novel defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets. Our methodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing pipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the area of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a UFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and anomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images demonstrates $93.8\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\%$ accuracy on good samples, with image-level AUROC of 0.957 and pixel-level AUROC of 0.961. The system provides potential annual cost savings through automated quality control and processing times of 0.5 seconds per image in on-device implementation.

Ali Nasseri	Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery, charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions. Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide': internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically, the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques. Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new generation of intelligent systems to improve surgical safety, efficiency, and training.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20939v1	Unlocking Noise-Resistant Vision: Key Architectural Secrets for Robust   Models	Bum Jun Kim; Makoto Kawano; Yusuke Iwasawa; Yutaka Matsuo	While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings, converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more robust against Gaussian noise.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20938v1	Autoregressive End-to-End Planning with Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment   and Multi-Objective Policy Refinement	Jianbo Zhao; Taiyu Ban; Xiangjie Li; Xingtai Gui; Hangning Zhou; Lei Liu; Hongwei Zhao; Bin Li	The inherent sequential modeling capabilities of autoregressive models make them a formidable baseline for end-to-end planning in autonomous driving. Nevertheless, their performance is constrained by a spatio-temporal misalignment, as the planner must condition future actions on past sensory data. This creates an inconsistent worldview, limiting the upper bound of performance for an otherwise powerful approach. To address this, we propose a Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module that learns to project initial environmental features into a consistent ego-centric frame for each future time step, effectively correcting the agent's worldview without explicit future scene prediction. In addition, we employ a kinematic action prediction head (i.e., acceleration and yaw rate) to ensure physically feasible trajectories. Finally, we introduce a multi-objective post-training stage using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to move beyond pure imitation. Our approach provides targeted feedback on specific driving behaviors, offering a more fine-grained learning signal than the single, overall objective used in standard DPO. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on the NAVSIM dataset among autoregressive models. The video document is available at https://tisa-dpo-e2e.github.io/.

Existing approaches often incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free, within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters (e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently, without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating compositional generalization.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20923v1	Revisiting Data Challenges of Computational Pathology: A Pack-based   Multiple Instance Learning Framework	Wenhao Tang; Heng Fang; Ge Wu; Xiang Li; Ming-Ming Cheng	Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths (up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential in the era of foundation models.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20918v1	SwinMamba: A hybrid local-global mamba framework for enhancing semantic   segmentation of remotely sensed images	Qinfeng Zhu; Han Li; Liang He; Lei Fan	Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts. To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details, while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image segmentation model.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20899v1	Concepts in Motion: Temporal Bottlenecks for Interpretable Video   Classification	Patrick Knab; Sascha Marton; Philipp J. Schubert; Drago Guggiana; Christian Bartelt	Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos, which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes, or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2) decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies (LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22 generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

G. van Sloun	Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation (KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video restoration.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	25/09/2025

Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets. Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods, particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in advancing VQA tasks.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20878v1	The Unanticipated Asymmetry Between Perceptual Optimization and   Assessment	Jiabei Zhang; Qi Wang; Siyu Wu; Du Chen; Tianhe Wu	Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives. These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled approaches to perceptual optimization.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20871v1	SCRA-VQA: Summarized Caption-Rerank for Augmented Large Language Models   in Visual Question Answering	Yan Zhang; Jiaqing Lin; Miao Zhang; Kui Xiao; Xiaoju Hou; Yue Zhao; Zhifei Li	Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%.

The 2016-th edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating 1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological correctness.   To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.   We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal biomarker segmentation.

Researchers have long leveraged virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), and augmented reality (AR) to enable immersive exploration and interpretation of architecture, enhancing accessibility, public understanding, and creative workflows around architecture in education, heritage preservation, and professional design practice. However, existing VR/MR/AR systems are often developed case-by-case, relying on hard-coded annotations and task-specific interactions that do not scale across diverse built environments. In this work, we present ArchGPT, a multimodal architectural visual question answering (VQA) model, together with a scalable data-construction pipeline for curating high-quality, architecture-specific VQA annotations. This pipeline yields Arch-300K, a domain-specialized dataset of approximately 315,000 image-question-answer triplets. Arch-300K is built via a multi-stage process: first, we curate architectural scenes from Wikimedia Commons and filter unconstrained tourist photo collections using a novel coarse-to-fine strategy that integrates 3D reconstruction and semantic segmentation to select occlusion-free, structurally consistent architectural images. To mitigate noise and inconsistency in raw textual metadata, we propose an LLM-guided text verification and knowledge-distillation pipeline to generate reliable, architecture-specific question-answer pairs. Using these curated images and refined metadata, we further synthesize formal analysis annotations-including detailed descriptions and aspect-guided conversations-to provide richer semantic variety while remaining faithful to the data. We perform supervised fine-tuning of an open-source multimodal backbone ,ShareGPT4V-7B, on Arch-300K, yielding ArchGPT.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	25/09/2025

Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant. However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision, we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting, from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant counting.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20856v1	Plant identification based on noisy web data: the amazing performance of   deep learning (LifeCLEF 2017)	Herve Goeau; Pierre Bonnet; Alexis Joly	The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20854v1	Punching Above Precision: Small Quantized Model Distillation with   Learnable Regularizer	Abdur Rehman; S M A Sharif; Md Abdur Rahaman; Mohamed Jismy Aashik Rasool; Seongwan Kim; Jaeho Lee	Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals, improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models (SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for real-world deployment.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20852v1	FHRFormer: A Self-supervised Transformer Approach for Fetal Heart Rate   Inpainting and Forecasting	Kjersti Engan; Neel Kanwal; Anita Yeconia; Ladislaus Blacy; Yuda Munyaw; Estomih Mduma; Hege Ersdal	Approximately 10\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at birth, and around 5\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated (AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more robust risk detection.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20851v1	Poisoning Prompt-Guided Sampling in Video Large Language Models	Yuxin Cao; Wei Song; Jingling Xue; Jin Song Dong	Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20824v1	ARMesh: Autoregressive Mesh Generation via Next-Level-of-Detail   Prediction	Jiabao Lei; Kewei Shi; Zhihao Liang; Kui Jia	Directly generating 3D meshes, the default representation for 3D shapes in the graphics industry, using auto-regressive (AR) models has become popular these days, thanks to their sharpness, compactness in the generated results, and ability to represent various types of surfaces. However, AR mesh generative models typically construct meshes face by face in lexicographic order, which does not effectively capture the underlying geometry in a manner consistent with human perception. Inspired by 2D models that progressively refine images, such as the prevailing next-scale prediction AR models, we propose generating meshes auto-regressively in a progressive coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, we view mesh simplification algorithms, which gradually merge mesh faces to build simpler meshes, as a natural fine-to-coarse process. Therefore, we generalize meshes to simplicial complexes and develop a transformer-based AR model to approximate the reverse process of simplification in the order of level of detail, constructing meshes initially from a single point and gradually adding geometric details through local remeshing, where the topology is not predefined and is alterable. Our experiments show that this novel progressive mesh generation approach not only provides intuitive control over generation quality and time consumption by early stopping the auto-regressive process but also enables applications such as mesh refinement and editing.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20823v1	CaTS-Bench: Can Language Models Describe Numeric Time Series?	Luca Zhou; Pratham Yashwante; Marshall Fisher; Alessio Sampieri; Zihao Zhou; Fabio Galasso; Rose Yu	Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning. CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies, and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style. Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation models.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20813v1	Revolutionizing Precise Low Back Pain Diagnosis via Contrastive Learning	Thanh Binh Le; Hoang Nhat Khang Vo; Tan-Ha Mai; Trong Nhan Phan	Low back pain affects millions worldwide, driving the need for robust diagnostic models that can jointly analyze complex medical images and accompanying text reports. We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated dataset containing axial MRI views paired with expert-written reports, LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder to extract dense representations. These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to 95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class imbalance. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that linear projection heads yield more effective cross-modal alignment than non-linear variants. LumbarCLIP offers a promising foundation for automated musculoskeletal diagnosis and clinical decision support.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20807v1	Federated Domain Generalization with Domain-specific Soft Prompts   Generation	Jianhan Wu; Xiaoyang Qu; Zhangcheng Huang; Jianzong Wang	Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG) methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20793v1	FERD: Fairness-Enhanced Data-Free Robustness Distillation	Zhengxiao Li; Liming Lu; Xu Zheng; Siyuan Liang; Zhenghan Chen; Yongbin Zhou; Shuchao Pang	Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues, leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and (2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack (e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by 15.1\% and 6.4\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior performance in both robustness and fairness aspects.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20792v1	DAC-LoRA: Dynamic Adversarial Curriculum for Efficient and Robust   Few-Shot Adaptation	Ved Umrajkar	Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition (FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy. Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20787v1	Real-Time Object Detection Meets DINOv3	Shihua Huang; Yongjie Hou; Longfei Liu; Xuanlong Yu; Xi Shen	Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features, resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter (STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets. Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters, surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model (9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers 38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer parameters.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20785v1	Dual-supervised Asymmetric Co-training for Semi-supervised Medical   Domain Generalization	Jincai Song; Haipeng Chen; Jun Qin; Na Zhao	Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing, addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However, conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization (CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG. Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

CompressAI-Vision is introduced as a comprehensive evaluation platform where new coding tools compete to efficiently compress the input of vision network while retaining task accuracy in the context of two different inference scenarios: ""remote"" and ""split"" inferencing. Our study showcases various use cases of the evaluation platform incorporated with standard codecs (under development) by examining the compression gain on several datasets in terms of bit-rate versus task accuracy.

However, current approaches face degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper acceptance.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	25/09/2025

Najm; Laurent Capolungo; Cosmin Safta	Phase-field models of liquid metal dealloying (LMD) can resolve rich microstructural dynamics but become intractable for large domains or long time horizons. We present a conditionally parameterized, fully convolutional U-Net surrogate that generalizes far beyond its training window in both space and time. The design integrates convolutional self-attention and physics-aware padding, while parameter conditioning enables variable time-step skipping and adaptation to diverse alloy systems. Although trained only on short, small-scale simulations, the surrogate exploits the translational invariance of convolutions to extend predictions to much longer horizons than traditional solvers. It accurately reproduces key LMD physics, with relative errors typically under 5% within the training regime and below 10% when extrapolating to larger domains and later times. The method accelerates computations by up to 16,000 times, cutting weeks of simulation down to seconds, and marks an early step toward scalable, high-fidelity extrapolation of LMD phase-field models.

The system constructs a dual-modal knowledge base from reference texts and images, enabling raw visual, edge-enhanced, and semantic retrieval to identify stylistically similar objects. Retrieved candidates are synthesized by the VLM to generate structured inferences, including chronological, geographical, and cultural attributions, alongside interpretive justifications. We evaluate the system on a set of Eastern Eurasian Bronze Age artifacts from the British Museum.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20757v1	MASt3R-Fusion: Integrating Feed-Forward Visual Model with IMU, GNSS for   High-Functionality SLAM	Yuxuan Zhou; Xingxing Li; Shengyu Li; Zhuohao Yan; Chunxi Xia; Shaoquan Feng	Visual SLAM is a cornerstone technique in robotics, autonomous driving and extended reality (XR), yet classical systems often struggle with low-texture environments, scale ambiguity, and degraded performance under challenging visual conditions. Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	25/09/2025

However, existing image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose \textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information. Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled, style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20751v1	Seeing Through Words, Speaking Through Pixels: Deep Representational   Alignment Between Vision and Language Models	Zoe Wanying He; Sean Trott; Meenakshi Khosla	"Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios, and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered (e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a forced-choice ""Pick-a-Pic"" task shows that human preferences for image-caption matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation."

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20748v1	AI-Enabled Crater-Based Navigation for Lunar Mapping	Sofia McLeod; Chee-Kheng Chng; Matthew Rodda; Tat-Jun Chin	Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration, with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

To address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy, particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code is available at https://github.com/gy65896/Neptune-X.

A hierarchical vision-language perception module fuses scene-level context with object-level cues for robust semantic inference. And a semantic-probabilistic topological map supports coarse-to-fine planning: LLM-based global reasoning for subgoal selection and vision-based local planning for obstacle avoidance. Integrated with reinforcement-learning locomotion controllers, the framework is deployable across diverse legged robot platforms. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic accuracy, planning quality, and navigation success, while ablation studies further showcase the necessity of both hierarchical perception and fine local planning. This work introduces a new paradigm for SLAM-free, vision-language-driven navigation, shifting robotic exploration from geometry-centric mapping to semantics-driven decision making.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20725v1	SeamCrafte: Enhancing Mesh Seam Generation for Artist UV Unwrapping via   Reinforcement Learning	Duoteng Xu; Yuguang Chen; Jing Li; Xinhai Liu; Xueqi Ma; Zhuo Chen; Dongyu Zhang; Chunchao Guo	Mesh seams play a pivotal role in partitioning 3D surfaces for UV parametrization and texture mapping. Poorly placed seams often result in severe UV distortion or excessive fragmentation, thereby hindering texture synthesis and disrupting artist workflows. Existing methods frequently trade one failure mode for another-producing either high distortion or many scattered islands. To address this, we introduce SeamCrafter, an autoregressive GPT-style seam generator conditioned on point cloud inputs. SeamCrafter employs a dual-branch point-cloud encoder that disentangles and captures complementary topological and geometric cues during pretraining. To further enhance seam quality, we fine-tune the model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on a preference dataset derived from a novel seam-evaluation framework. This framework assesses seams primarily by UV distortion and fragmentation, and provides pairwise preference labels to guide optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SeamCrafter produces seams with substantially lower distortion and fragmentation than prior approaches, while preserving topological consistency and visual fidelity.

Rather than adjudicating truth, this study examines how credibility is packaged in nutrition and supplement videos by analyzing the intersection of authority signals, narrative techniques, and monetization. We assemble a cross platform corpus of 152 public videos from TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube and annotate each on 26 features spanning visual authority, presenter attributes, narrative strategies, and engagement cues. A transparent annotation pipeline integrates automatic speech recognition, principled frame selection, and a multimodal model, with human verification on a stratified subsample showing strong agreement. Descriptively, a confident single presenter in studio or home settings dominates, and clinical contexts are rare. Analytically, authority cues such as titles, slides and charts, and certificates frequently occur with persuasive elements including jargon, references, fear or urgency, critiques of mainstream medicine, and conspiracies, and with monetization including sales links and calls to subscribe. References and science like visuals often travel with emotive and oppositional narratives rather than signaling restraint.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	25/09/2025

To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals, and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of 1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6 types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics: multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions. Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group intention forecasting. The dataset is available at https://xinyi-hu.github.io/SHOT_DATASET.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20710v1	ArtUV: Artist-style UV Unwrapping	Yuguang Chen; Xinhai Liu; Yang Li; Victor Cheung; Zhuo Chen; Dongyu Zhang; Chunchao Guo	UV unwrapping is an essential task in computer graphics, enabling various visual editing operations in rendering pipelines. However, existing UV unwrapping methods struggle with time-consuming, fragmentation, lack of semanticity, and irregular UV islands, limiting their practical use. An artist-style UV map must not only satisfy fundamental criteria, such as overlap-free mapping and minimal distortion, but also uphold higher-level standards, including clean boundaries, efficient space utilization, and semantic coherence. We introduce ArtUV, a fully automated, end-to-end method for generating artist-style UV unwrapping. We simulates the professional UV mapping process by dividing it into two stages: surface seam prediction and artist-style UV parameterization. In the seam prediction stage, SeamGPT is used to generate semantically meaningful cutting seams. Then, in the parameterization stage, a rough UV obtained from an optimization-based method, along with the mesh, is fed into an Auto-Encoder, which refines it into an artist-style UV map. Our method ensures semantic consistency and preserves topological structure, making the UV map ready for 2D editing. We evaluate ArtUV across multiple benchmarks and show that it serves as a versatile solution, functioning seamlessly as either a plug-in for professional rendering tools or as a standalone system for rapid, high-quality UV generation.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20703v1	Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization For Feasible Robot Motion Generation   from Video Demonstrations	Xiaoxiang Dong; Matthew Johnson-Roberson; Weiming Zhi	Learning from human video demonstrations offers a scalable alternative to teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching, but poses challenges for robot manipulators due to embodiment differences and joint feasibility constraints. We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization (JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics. To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to $\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation tasks.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20701v1	DENet: Dual-Path Edge Network with Global-Local Attention for Infrared   Small Target Detection	Jiayi Zuo; Songwei Pei; Qian Li	Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms, which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20688v1	RAM-NAS: Resource-aware Multiobjective Neural Architecture Search Method   for Robot Vision Tasks	Shouren Mao; Minghao Qin; Wei Dong; Huajian Liu; Yongzhuo Gao	Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great promise in automatically designing lightweight models. However, conventional approaches are insufficient in training the supernet and pay little attention to actual robot hardware resources. To meet such challenges, we propose RAM-NAS, a resource-aware multi-objective NAS method that focuses on improving the supernet pretrain and resource-awareness on robot hardware devices. We introduce the concept of subnets mutual distillation, which refers to mutually distilling all subnets sampled by the sandwich rule. Additionally, we utilize the Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD) loss to enhance logits distillation performance. To expedite the search process with consideration for hardware resources, we used data from three types of robotic edge hardware to train Latency Surrogate predictors. These predictors facilitated the estimation of hardware inference latency during the search phase, enabling a unified multi-objective evolutionary search to balance model accuracy and latency trade-offs. Our discovered model family, RAM-NAS models, can achieve top-1 accuracy ranging from 76.7% to 81.4% on ImageNet. In addition, the resource-aware multi-objective NAS we employ significantly reduces the model's inference latency on edge hardware for robots. We conducted experiments on downstream tasks to verify the scalability of our methods. The inference time for detection and segmentation is reduced on all three hardware types compared to MobileNetv3-based methods. Our work fills the gap in NAS for robot hardware resource-aware.

Despite recent progress, existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20681v1	Efficient Construction of Implicit Surface Models From a Single Image   for Motion Generation	Wei-Teng Chu; Tianyi Zhang; Matthew Johnson-Roberson; Weiming Zhi	Implicit representations have been widely applied in robotics for obstacle avoidance and path planning. In this paper, we explore the problem of constructing an implicit distance representation from a single image. Past methods for implicit surface reconstruction, such as \emph{NeuS} and its variants generally require a large set of multi-view images as input, and require long training times. In this work, we propose Fast Image-to-Neural Surface (FINS), a lightweight framework that can reconstruct high-fidelity surfaces and SDF fields based on a single or a small set of images. FINS integrates a multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight geometry and color heads, making the training via an approximate second-order optimizer highly efficient and capable of converging within a few seconds. Additionally, we achieve the construction of a neural surface requiring only a single RGB image, by leveraging pre-trained foundation models to estimate the geometry inherent in the image. Our experiments demonstrate that under the same conditions, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both convergence speed and accuracy on surface reconstruction and SDF field estimation. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of FINS for robot surface following tasks and show its scalability to a variety of benchmark datasets.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20678v1	Bispectral OT: Dataset Comparison using Symmetry-Aware Optimal Transport	Annabel Ma; Kaiying Hou; David Alvarez-Melis; Melanie Weber	Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning, graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT on benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality of meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label structure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class or content.

While LiDARs and cameras struggle under extreme weather, 4D mmWave radar emerges as a robust alternative with all-weather operability and velocity measurement. In this paper, we introduce Equi-RO, an equivariant network-based framework for 4D radar odometry. Our algorithm pre-processes Doppler velocity into invariant node and edge features in the graph, and employs separate networks for equivariant and invariant feature processing. A graph-based architecture enhances feature aggregation in sparse radar data, improving inter-frame correspondence. Experiments on the open-source dataset and self-collected dataset show Equi-RO outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in accuracy and robustness. Overall, our method achieves 10.7% and 20.0% relative improvements in translation and rotation accuracy, respectively, compared to the best baseline on the open-source dataset.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20673v1	Human Semantic Representations of Social Interactions from Moving Shapes	Yiling Yun; Hongjing Lu	Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features, labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best. These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract representations.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20628v1	Recov-Vision: Linking Street View Imagery and Vision-Language Models for   Post-Disaster Recovery	Yiming Xiao; Archit Gupta; Miguel Esparza; Yu-Hsuan Ho; Antonia Sebastian; Hannah Weas; Rose Houck; Ali Mostafavi	Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections, utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level, language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into geospatial and emergency-management workflows.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	25/09/2025

Methods such as Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Differential Privacy (DP) often incur high compu- tational costs and suffer from limited scalability. This survey examines emerging approaches that hold promise for enhancing both privacy and efficiency in FL, including Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), Quantum Computing (QC), Chaos-Based Encryption (CBE), Neuromorphic Computing (NC), and Swarm Intelligence (SI). For each paradigm, we assess its relevance to the FL pipeline, outlining its strengths, limitations, and practical considerations. We conclude by highlighting open challenges and prospective research avenues, offering a detailed roadmap for advancing secure and scalable FL systems.	Cryptography and Security	25/09/2025

Adversaries now craft multi-modal campaigns that combine natural-language text with obfuscated URLs, forged headers, and malicious attachments, adapting their strategies within days to bypass filters. Traditional spam detection systems, which rely on static rules or single-modality models, struggle to integrate heterogeneous signals or to continuously adapt, leading to rapid performance degradation.   We propose EvoMail, a self-evolving cognitive agent framework for robust detection of spam and phishing. EvoMail first constructs a unified heterogeneous email graph that fuses textual content, metadata (headers, senders, domains), and embedded resources (URLs, attachments). A Cognitive Graph Neural Network enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) performs context-aware reasoning across these sources to identify coordinated spam campaigns. Most critically, EvoMail engages in an adversarial self-evolution loop: a ''red-team'' agent generates novel evasion tactics -- such as character obfuscation or AI-generated phishing text -- while the ''blue-team'' detector learns from failures, compresses experiences into a memory module, and reuses them for future reasoning.   Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam, SpamAssassin, and TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants demonstrate that EvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy, adaptability to evolving spam tactics, and interpretability of reasoning traces. These results highlight EvoMail's potential as a resilient and explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing threats.	Cryptography and Security	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.21057v1	PMark: Towards Robust and Distortion-free Semantic-level Watermarking   with Channel Constraints	Jiahao Huo; Shuliang Liu; Bin Wang; Junyan Zhang; Yibo Yan; Aiwei Liu; Xuming Hu; Mingxun Zhou	Semantic-level watermarking (SWM) for large language models (LLMs) enhances watermarking robustness against text modifications and paraphrasing attacks by treating the sentence as the fundamental unit. However, existing methods still lack strong theoretical guarantees of robustness, and reject-sampling-based generation often introduces significant distribution distortions compared with unwatermarked outputs. In this work, we introduce a new theoretical framework on SWM through the concept of proxy functions (PFs) $\unicode{x2013}$ functions that map sentences to scalar values. Building on this framework, we propose PMark, a simple yet powerful SWM method that estimates the PF median for the next sentence dynamically through sampling while enforcing multiple PF constraints (which we call channels) to strengthen watermark evidence. Equipped with solid theoretical guarantees, PMark achieves the desired distortion-free property and improves the robustness against paraphrasing-style attacks. We also provide an empirically optimized version that further removes the requirement for dynamical median estimation for better sampling efficiency. Experimental results show that PMark consistently outperforms existing SWM baselines in both text quality and robustness, offering a more effective paradigm for detecting machine-generated text. Our code will be released at [this URL](https://github.com/PMark-repo/PMark).	Cryptography and Security	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.21011v1	Automatic Red Teaming LLM-based Agents with Model Context Protocol Tools	Ping He; Changjiang Li; Binbin Zhao; Tianyu Du; Shouling Ji	The remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) has led to the wide application of LLM-based agents in various domains. To standardize interactions between LLM-based agents and their environments, model context protocol (MCP) tools have become the de facto standard and are now widely integrated into these agents. However, the incorporation of MCP tools introduces the risk of tool poisoning attacks, which can manipulate the behavior of LLM-based agents. Although previous studies have identified such vulnerabilities, their red teaming approaches have largely remained at the proof-of-concept stage, leaving the automatic and systematic red teaming of LLM-based agents under the MCP tool poisoning paradigm an open question. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoMalTool, an automated red teaming framework for LLM-based agents by generating malicious MCP tools. Our extensive evaluation shows that AutoMalTool effectively generates malicious MCP tools capable of manipulating the behavior of mainstream LLM-based agents while evading current detection mechanisms, thereby revealing new security risks in these agents.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20972v1	Dual-Path Phishing Detection: Integrating Transformer-Based NLP with   Structural URL Analysis	Ibrahim Altan; Abdulla Bachir; Yousuf Parbhulkar; Abdul Muksith Rizvi; Moshiur Farazi	Phishing emails pose a persistent and increasingly sophisticated threat, undermining email security through deceptive tactics designed to exploit both semantic and structural vulnerabilities. Traditional detection methods, often based on isolated analysis of email content or embedded URLs, fail to comprehensively address these evolving attacks. In this paper, we propose a dual-path phishing detection framework that integrates transformer-based natural language processing (NLP) with classical machine learning to jointly analyze email text and embedded URLs. Our approach leverages the complementary strengths of semantic analysis using fine-tuned transformer architectures (e.g., DistilBERT) and structural link analysis via character-level TF-IDF vectorization paired with classical classifiers (e.g., Random Forest). Empirical evaluation on representative email and URL datasets demonstrates that this combined approach significantly improves detection accuracy. Specifically, the DistilBERT model achieves a near-optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency for textual phishing detection, while Random Forest notably outperforms other classical classifiers in identifying malicious URLs. The modular design allows flexibility for standalone deployment or ensemble integration, facilitating real-world adoption. Collectively, our results highlight the efficacy and practical value of this dual-path approach, establishing a scalable, accurate, and interpretable solution capable of enhancing email security against contemporary phishing threats.

A.; Karthika R	Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) enables organizations to anticipate, detect, and mitigate evolving cyber threats. Its effectiveness depends on high-quality datasets, which support model development, training, evaluation, and benchmarking. Building such datasets is crucial, as attack vectors and adversary tactics continually evolve. Recently, Telegram has gained prominence as a valuable CTI source, offering timely and diverse threat-related information that can help address these challenges. In this work, we address these challenges by presenting an end-to-end automated pipeline that systematically collects and filters threat-related content from Telegram. The pipeline identifies relevant Telegram channels and scrapes 145,349 messages from 12 curated channels out of 150 identified sources. To accurately filter threat intelligence messages from generic content, we employ a BERT-based classifier, achieving an accuracy of 96.64%. From the filtered messages, we compile a dataset of 86,509 malicious Indicators of Compromise, including domains, IPs, URLs, hashes, and CVEs. This approach not only produces a large-scale, high-fidelity CTI dataset but also establishes a foundation for future research and operational applications in cyber threat detection.

In this paper, we argue that existing evaluations are not sufficiently adversarial, obscuring critical vulnerabilities and overstating the security. To address this, we introduce adaptive robustness radius, a formal metric that quantifies watermark resilience against adaptive adversaries. We theoretically prove that optimizing the attack context and model parameters can substantially reduce this radius, making watermarks highly susceptible to paraphrase attacks. Leveraging this insight, we propose RLCracker, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based adaptive attack that erases watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity. RLCracker requires only limited watermarked examples and zero access to the detector. Despite weak supervision, it empowers a 3B model to achieve 98.5% removal success and an average 0.92 P-SP score on 1,500-token Unigram-marked texts after training on only 100 short samples. This performance dramatically exceeds 6.75% by GPT-4o and generalizes across five model sizes over ten watermarking schemes. Our results confirm that adaptive attacks are broadly effective and pose a fundamental threat to current watermarking defenses.	Cryptography and Security	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20880v1	A Generalized $χ_n$-Function	Cheng Lyu; Mu Yuan; Dabin Zheng; Siwei Sun; Shun Li	The mapping $\chi_n$ from $\F_{2}^{n}$ to itself defined by $y=\chi_n(x)$ with $y_i=x_i+x_{i+2}(1+x_{i+1})$, where the indices are computed modulo $n$, has been widely studied for its applications in lightweight cryptography. However, $\chi_n $ is bijective on $\F_2^n$ only when $n$ is odd, restricting its use to odd-dimensional vector spaces over $\F_2$. To address this limitation, we introduce and analyze the generalized mapping $\chi_{n, m}$ defined by $y=\chi_{n,m}(x)$ with $y_i=x_i+x_{i+m} (x_{i+m-1}+1)(x_{i+m-2}+1) \cdots (x_{i+1}+1)$, where $m$ is a fixed integer with $m\nmid n$. To investigate such mappings, we further generalize $\chi_{n,m}$ to $\theta_{m, k}$, where $\theta_{m, k}$ is given by $y_i=x_{i+mk} \prod_{\substack{j=1,\,\, m \nmid j}}^{mk-1} \left(x_{i+j}+1\right), \,\,{\rm for }\,\, i\in \{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$. We prove that these mappings generate an abelian group isomorphic to the group of units in $\F_2[z]/(z^{\lfloor n/m\rfloor +1})$. This structural insight enables us to construct a broad class of permutations over $\F_2^n$ for any positive integer $n$, along with their inverses. We rigorously analyze algebraic properties of these mappings, including their iterations, fixed points, and cycle structures. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive database of the cryptographic properties for iterates of $\chi_{n,m}$ for small values of $n$ and $m$. Finally, we conduct a comparative security and implementation cost analysis among $\chi_{n,m}$, $\chi_n$, $\chi\chi_n$ (EUROCRYPT 2025 \cite{belkheyar2025chi}) and their variants, and prove Conjecture~1 proposed in~\cite{belkheyar2025chi} as a by-product of our study. Our results lead to generalizations of $\chi_n$, providing alternatives to $\chi_n$ and $\chi\chi_n$.	Cryptography and Security	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20861v1	FlowXpert: Context-Aware Flow Embedding for Enhanced Traffic Detection   in IoT Network	Chao Zha; Haolin Pan; Bing Bai; Jiangxing Wu; Ruyun Zhang	In the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, continuous interaction among a large number of devices generates complex and dynamic network traffic, which poses significant challenges to rule-based detection approaches. Machine learning (ML)-based traffic detection technology, capable of identifying anomalous patterns and potential threats within this traffic, serves as a critical component in ensuring network security. This study first identifies a significant issue with widely adopted feature extraction tools (e.g., CICMeterFlow): the extensive use of time- and length-related features leads to high sparsity, which adversely affects model convergence. Furthermore, existing traffic detection methods generally lack an embedding mechanism capable of efficiently and comprehensively capturing the semantic characteristics of network traffic. To address these challenges, we propose a novel feature extraction tool that eliminates traditional time and length features in favor of context-aware semantic features related to the source host, thus improving the generalizability of the model. In addition, we design an embedding training framework that integrates the unsupervised DBSCAN clustering algorithm with a contrastive learning strategy to effectively capture fine-grained semantic representations of traffic. Extensive empirical evaluations are conducted on the real-world Mawi data set to validate the proposed method in terms of detection accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Comparative experiments against several state-of-the-art (SOTA) models demonstrate the superior performance of our approach. Furthermore, we confirm its applicability and deployability in real-time scenarios.	Cryptography and Security	25/09/2025

Inspired by the positive impact of the adversarial attack, a pair of pluggable encryption and decryption modules is designed in the proposed SS-ISAC framework. The encryption module is installed after the semantic transmitter, adopting a trainable adversarial residual network (ARN) to create the adversarial attack. Correspondingly, the decryption module before the semantic receiver utilizes another trainable ARN to mitigate the adversarial attack and noise. These two modules can be flexibly assembled considering the system security demands, without drastically modifying the hardware infrastructure. To ensure the sensing and communication (SAC) performance while preventing the eavesdropping threat, the above ARNs are jointly optimized by minimizing a carefully designed loss function that relates to the adversarial attack power, SAC performance, as well as the privacy leakage risk. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed SS-ISAC framework in terms of both SAC and eavesdropping prevention performance.	Cryptography and Security	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20808v1	Intelligent Graybox Fuzzing via ATPG-Guided Seed Generation and   Submodule Analysis	Raghul Saravanan; Sudipta Paria; Aritra Dasgupta; Swarup Bhunia; Sai Manoj P D	Hardware Fuzzing emerged as one of the crucial techniques for finding security flaws in modern hardware designs by testing a wide range of input scenarios. One of the main challenges is creating high-quality input seeds that maximize coverage and speed up verification. Coverage-Guided Fuzzing (CGF) methods help explore designs more effectively, but they struggle to focus on specific parts of the hardware. Existing Directed Gray-box Fuzzing (DGF) techniques like DirectFuzz try to solve this by generating targeted tests, but it has major drawbacks, such as supporting only limited hardware description languages, not scaling well to large circuits, and having issues with abstraction mismatches. To address these problems, we introduce a novel framework, PROFUZZ, that follows the DGF approach and combines fuzzing with Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) for more efficient fuzzing. By leveraging ATPG's structural analysis capabilities, PROFUZZ can generate precise input seeds that target specific design regions more effectively while maintaining high fuzzing throughput. Our experiments show that PROFUZZ scales 30x better than DirectFuzz when handling multiple target sites, improves coverage by 11.66%, and runs 2.76x faster, highlighting its scalability and effectiveness for directed fuzzing in complex hardware systems.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20796v1	Fast Revocable Attribute-Based Encryption with Data Integrity for   Internet of Things	Yongjiao Li; Liang Zhu; Yalin Deng; Qikun Zhang; Zhenlei Wang; Zhu Cao	Efficient and secure revocable attribute-based encryption (RABE) is vital for ensuring flexible and fine-grained access control and data sharing in cloud storage and outsourced data environments within the Internet of Things (IoT). However, current RABE schemes often struggle to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency, security, dynamic scalability, and other important features, which hampers their practical application. To overcome these limitations, we propose a fast RABE scheme with data integrity for IoT that achieves adaptive security with multiple challenge ciphertexts. Our scheme supports the revocation of authorized users and transfers the computationally heavy revocation processes to the cloud, thereby easing the computational burden on IoT devices. Moreover, it consistently guarantees the integrity and correctness of data. We have demonstrated its adaptive security within the defined security model with multiple challenge ciphertexts and optimized its performance. Experimental results indicate that our scheme provides better performance than existing solutions. Under the same access policy, our scheme reduces computational consumption by 7 to 9 times compared to previous schemes.	Cryptography and Security	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20767v1	ExpIDS: A Drift-adaptable Network Intrusion Detection System With   Improved Explainability	Ayush Kumar; Kar Wai Fok; Vrizlynn L. L. Thing	Despite all the advantages associated with Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) that utilize machine learning (ML) models, there is a significant reluctance among cyber security experts to implement these models in real-world production settings. This is primarily because of their opaque nature, meaning it is unclear how and why the models make their decisions. In this work, we design a deep learning-based NIDS, ExpIDS to have high decision tree explanation fidelity, i.e., the predictions of decision tree explanation corresponding to ExpIDS should be as close to ExpIDS's predictions as possible. ExpIDS can also adapt to changes in network traffic distribution (drift). With the help of extensive experiments, we verify that ExpIDS achieves higher decision tree explanation fidelity and a malicious traffic detection performance comparable to state-of-the-art NIDSs for common attacks with varying levels of real-world drift.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20714v1	Cryptographic Backdoor for Neural Networks: Boon and Bane	Anh Tu Ngo; Anupam Chattopadhyay; Subhamoy Maitra	In this paper we show that cryptographic backdoors in a neural network (NN) can be highly effective in two directions, namely mounting the attacks as well as in presenting the defenses as well. On the attack side, a carefully planted cryptographic backdoor enables powerful and invisible attack on the NN. Considering the defense, we present applications: first, a provably robust NN watermarking scheme; second, a protocol for guaranteeing user authentication; and third, a protocol for tracking unauthorized sharing of the NN intellectual property (IP). From a broader theoretical perspective, borrowing the ideas from Goldwasser et. al. [FOCS 2022], our main contribution is to show that all these instantiated practical protocol implementations are provably robust. The protocols for watermarking, authentication and IP tracking resist an adversary with black-box access to the NN, whereas the backdoor-enabled adversarial attack is impossible to prevent under the standard assumptions. While the theoretical tools used for our attack is mostly in line with the Goldwasser et. al. ideas, the proofs related to the defense need further studies. Finally, all these protocols are implemented on state-of-the-art NN architectures with empirical results corroborating the theoretical claims. Further, one can utilize post-quantum primitives for implementing the cryptographic backdoors, laying out foundations for quantum-era applications in machine learning (ML).

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20697v1	Average-Case Complexity of Quantum Stabilizer Decoding	Andrey Boris Khesin; Jonathan Z. Lu; Alexander Poremba; Akshar Ramkumar; Vinod Vaikuntanathan	Random classical linear codes are widely believed to be hard to decode. While slightly sub-exponential time algorithms exist when the coding rate vanishes sufficiently rapidly, all known algorithms at constant rate require exponential time. By contrast, the complexity of decoding a random quantum stabilizer code has remained an open question for quite some time. This work closes the gap in our understanding of the algorithmic hardness of decoding random quantum versus random classical codes. We prove that decoding a random stabilizer code with even a single logical qubit is at least as hard as decoding a random classical code at constant rate--the maximally hard regime. This result suggests that the easiest random quantum decoding problem is at least as hard as the hardest random classical decoding problem, and shows that any sub-exponential algorithm decoding a typical stabilizer code, at any rate, would immediately imply a breakthrough in cryptography.   More generally, we also characterize many other complexity-theoretic properties of stabilizer codes. While classical decoding admits a random self-reduction, we prove significant barriers for the existence of random self-reductions in the quantum case. This result follows from new bounds on Clifford entropies and Pauli mixing times, which may be of independent interest. As a complementary result, we demonstrate various other self-reductions which are in fact achievable, such as between search and decision. We also demonstrate several ways in which quantum phenomena, such as quantum degeneracy, force several reasonable definitions of stabilizer decoding--all of which are classically identical--to have distinct or non-trivially equivalent complexity.

Despite being increasingly deployed in real platforms, the reliability aspects of FHE systems, especially how they respond to faults, have been mostly neglected. This paper aims to better understand of how FHE computation behaves in the presence of memory faults, both in terms of individual operations as well as at the level of applications, for different FHE schemes. Finally, we investigate how effective traditional and FHE-specific fault mitigation techniques are.	Cryptography and Security	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20680v1	Can Federated Learning Safeguard Private Data in LLM Training?   Vulnerabilities, Attacks, and Defense Evaluation	Wenkai Guo; Xuefeng Liu; Haolin Wang; Jianwei Niu; Shaojie Tang; Jing Yuan	Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains. Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers can still extract training data from the global model, even using straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL, including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.	Cryptography and Security	25/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20639v1	A Framework for Rapidly Developing and Deploying Protection Against   Large Language Model Attacks	Adam Swanda; Amy Chang; Alexander Chen; Fraser Burch; Paul Kassianik; Konstantin Berlin	The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized AI deployment, enabling autonomous and semi-autonomous applications across industries through intuitive language interfaces and continuous improvements in model development. However, the attendant increase in autonomy and expansion of access permissions among AI applications also make these systems compelling targets for malicious attacks. Their inherent susceptibility to security flaws necessitates robust defenses, yet no known approaches can prevent zero-day or novel attacks against LLMs. This places AI protection systems in a category similar to established malware protection systems: rather than providing guaranteed immunity, they minimize risk through enhanced observability, multi-layered defense, and rapid threat response, supported by a threat intelligence function designed specifically for AI-related threats.   Prior work on LLM protection has largely evaluated individual detection models rather than end-to-end systems designed for continuous, rapid adaptation to a changing threat landscape. We present a production-grade defense system rooted in established malware detection and threat intelligence practices. Our platform integrates three components: a threat intelligence system that turns emerging threats into protections; a data platform that aggregates and enriches information while providing observability, monitoring, and ML operations; and a release platform enabling safe, rapid detection updates without disrupting customer workflows. Together, these components deliver layered protection against evolving LLM threats while generating training data for continuous model improvement and deploying updates without interrupting production.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20592v1	Beyond SSO: Mobile Money Authentication for Inclusive e-Government in   Sub-Saharan Africa	Oluwole Adewusi; Wallace S. Msagusa; Jean Pierre Imanirumva; Okemawo Obadofin; Jema D. Ndibwile	The rapid adoption of Mobile Money Services (MMS) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) offers a viable path to improve e-Government service accessibility in the face of persistent low internet penetration. However, existing Mobile Money Authentication (MMA) methods face critical limitations, including susceptibility to SIM swapping, weak session protection, and poor scalability during peak demand. This study introduces a hybrid MMA framework that combines Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD)-based multi-factor authentication with secure session management via cryptographically bound JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Unlike traditional MMA systems that rely solely on SIM-PIN verification or smartphone-dependent biometrics, our design implements a three-factor authentication model; SIM verification, PIN entry, and session token binding, tailored for resource-constrained environments. Simulations and comparative analysis against OAuth-based Single Sign-On (SSO) methods reveal a 45% faster authentication time (8 seconds vs. 12 to 15 seconds), 15% higher success under poor network conditions (95% vs. 80%), and increased resistance to phishing and brute-force attacks. Penetration testing and threat modeling further demonstrate a substantial reduction in vulnerability exposure compared to conventional approaches. The primary contributions of this work are: (1) a hybrid authentication protocol that ensures offline accessibility and secure session continuity; (2) a tailored security framework addressing threats like SIM swapping and social engineering in SSA; and (3) demonstrated scalability for thousands of users with reduced infrastructure overhead. The proposed approach advances secure digital inclusion in SSA and other regions with similar constraints.	Cryptography and Security	24/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20589v1	Every Character Counts: From Vulnerability to Defense in Phishing   Detection	Maria Chiper; Radu Tudor Ionescu	Phishing attacks targeting both organizations and individuals are becoming an increasingly significant threat as technology advances. Current automatic detection methods often lack explainability and robustness in detecting new phishing attacks. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of character-level deep learning models for phishing detection, which can provide both robustness and interpretability. We evaluate three neural architectures adapted to operate at the character level, namely CharCNN, CharGRU, and CharBiLSTM, on a custom-built email dataset, which combines data from multiple sources. Their performance is analyzed under three scenarios: (i) standard training and testing, (ii) standard training and testing under adversarial attacks, and (iii) training and testing with adversarial examples. Aiming to develop a tool that operates as a browser extension, we test all models under limited computational resources. In this constrained setup, CharGRU proves to be the best-performing model across all scenarios. All models show vulnerability to adversarial attacks, but adversarial training substantially improves their robustness. In addition, by adapting the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique to character-level inputs, we are able to visualize which parts of each email influence the decision of each model. Our open-source code and data is released at https://github.com/chipermaria/every-character-counts.	Cryptography and Security	24/09/2025

Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of 96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72 sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent, underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20476v1	Advancing Practical Homomorphic Encryption for Federated Learning:   Theoretical Guarantees and Efficiency Optimizations	Ren-Yi Huang; Dumindu Samaraweera; Prashant Shekhar; J. Morris Chang	Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy by keeping raw data locally stored on client devices, preventing access from other clients or the central server. However, recent studies reveal that sharing model gradients creates vulnerability to Model Inversion Attacks, particularly Deep Leakage from Gradients (DLG), which reconstructs private training data from shared gradients. While Homomorphic Encryption has been proposed as a promising defense mechanism to protect gradient privacy, fully encrypting all model gradients incurs high computational overhead. Selective encryption approaches aim to balance privacy protection with computational efficiency by encrypting only specific gradient components. However, the existing literature largely overlooks a theoretical exploration of the spectral behavior of encrypted versus unencrypted parameters, relying instead primarily on empirical evaluations. To address this gap, this paper presents a framework for theoretical analysis of the underlying principles of selective encryption as a defense against model inversion attacks. We then provide a comprehensive empirical study that identifies and quantifies the critical factors, such as model complexity, encryption ratios, and exposed gradients, that influence defense effectiveness. Our theoretical framework clarifies the relationship between gradient selection and privacy preservation, while our experimental evaluation demonstrates how these factors shape the robustness of defenses against model inversion attacks. Collectively, these contributions advance the understanding of selective encryption mechanisms and offer principled guidance for designing efficient, scalable, privacy-preserving federated learning systems.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20472v1	Computational Relative Entropy	Johannes Jakob Meyer; Asad Raza; Jacopo Rizzo; Lorenzo Leone; Sofiene Jerbi; Jens Eisert	Our capacity to process information depends on the computational power at our disposal. Information theory captures our ability to distinguish states or communicate messages when it is unconstrained with unrivaled elegance. For computationally bounded observers the situation is quite different. They can, for example, be fooled to believe that distributions are more random than they actually are. In our work, we go beyond the prevailing single-shot approach and take a new direction in computational quantum information theory that captures the essence of complexity-constrained information theory while retaining the look and feel of the unbounded asymptotic theory. As our foundational quantity, we define the computational relative entropy as the optimal error exponent in asymmetric hypothesis testing when restricted to polynomially many copies and quantum gates, defined in a mathematically rigorous way. Building on this foundation, we prove a computational analogue of Stein's lemma, establish computational versions of fundamental inequalities like Pinsker's bound, and demonstrate a computational smoothing property showing that computationally indistinguishable states yield equivalent information measures. We derive a computational entropy that operationally characterizes optimal compression rates for quantum states under computational limitations and show that our quantities apply to computational entanglement theory, proving a computational version of the Rains bound. Our framework reveals striking separations between computational and unbounded information measures, including quantum-classical gaps that arise from cryptographic assumptions, demonstrating that computational constraints fundamentally alter the information-theoretic landscape and open new research directions at the intersection of quantum information, complexity theory, and cryptography.

We model analyst observations of networked states as time-series outputs of a graph filter driven by differentially private (DP) nodal excitations, with the analyst aiming to infer the underlying graph shift operator (GSO). Unlike traditional SI, which estimates system parameters, we study the inverse problem: what assumptions prevent adversaries from identifying the GSO while preserving utility for legitimate analysis. We show that applying DP mechanisms to inputs provides formal privacy guarantees for the GSO, linking the $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP bound to the spectral properties of the graph filter and noise covariance. More precisely, for DP Gaussian signals, the spectral characteristics of both the filter and noise covariance determine the privacy bound, with smooth filters and low-condition-number covariance yielding greater privacy.

Several studies have successfully shown the potential of EEG data for re-identification and leakage of other personal information. Therefore, the increasing availability of EEG consumer devices raises concerns about user privacy, motivating us to investigate how to safeguard this sensitive data while retaining its utility for EEG applications. To address this challenge, we propose a transformer-based autoencoder to create EEG data that does not allow for subject re-identification while still retaining its utility for specific machine learning tasks. We apply our approach to automatic sleep staging by evaluating the re-identification and utility potential of EEG data before and after anonymization. The results show that the re-identifiability of the EEG signal can be substantially reduced while preserving its utility for machine learning.	Cryptography and Security	24/09/2025

Thus, the security of ATT is highly critical for real-world applications. Under the scope, we present a new type of attack: distance-pulling attacks (DPA) and a systematic study of it, which exploits vulnerabilities in ATT systems to dangerously reduce tracking distances, leading to drone capturing, increased susceptibility to sensor attacks, or even physical collisions. To achieve these goals, we present FlyTrap, a novel physical-world attack framework that employs an adversarial umbrella as a deployable and domain-specific attack vector. FlyTrap is specifically designed to meet key desired objectives in attacking ATT drones: physical deployability, closed-loop effectiveness, and spatial-temporal consistency. Through novel progressive distance-pulling strategy and controllable spatial-temporal consistency designs, FlyTrap manipulates ATT drones in real-world setups to achieve significant system-level impacts. Our evaluations include new datasets, metrics, and closed-loop experiments on real-world white-box and even commercial ATT drones, including DJI and HoverAir. Results demonstrate FlyTrap's ability to reduce tracking distances within the range to be captured, sensor attacked, or even directly crashed, highlighting urgent security risks and practical implications for the safe deployment of ATT systems.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20356v1	chainScale: Secure Functionality-oriented Scalability for Decentralized   Resource Markets	Mohamed E. Najd; Ghada Almashaqbeh	Decentralized resource markets are Web 3.0 applications that build open-access platforms for trading digital resources among users without any central management. They promise cost reduction, transparency, and flexible service provision. However, these markets usually have large workload that must be processed in a timely manner, leading to serious scalability problems. Despite the large amount of work on blockchain scalability, existing solutions are ineffective as they do not account for these markets' work models and traffic patterns.   We introduce chainScale, a secure hybrid sidechain-sharding solution that aims to boost throughput of decentralized resource markets and reduce their latency and storage footprint. At its core, chainScale leverages dependent sidechains and functionality-oriented workload splitting to parallelize traffic processing by having each market module assigned to a sidechain. Different from sharding, chainScale does not incur any cross-sidechain transactions that tend to be costly. chainScale introduces several techniques, including hierarchical workload sharing that further sub-divides overloaded modules, and weighted miner assignment that assigns miners with vested interest in the system to critical modules' sidechains. Furthermore, chainScale employs sidechain syncing to maintain the mainchain as the single truth of system state, and pruning to discard stale records. Beside analyzing security, we build a proof-of-concept implementation for a distributed file storage market as a use case. Our experiments show that, compared to a single sidechain-based prior solution, chainScale boosts throughput by 4x and reduces confirmation latency by 5x. Also, they show that chainScale outperforms sharding by 2.5x in throughput and 3.5x in latency.	Cryptography and Security	24/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20324v1	RAG Security and Privacy: Formalizing the Threat Model and Attack   Surface	Atousa Arzanipour; Rouzbeh Behnia; Reza Ebrahimi; Kaushik Dutta	Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an emerging approach in natural language processing that combines large language models (LLMs) with external document retrieval to produce more accurate and grounded responses. While RAG has shown strong potential in reducing hallucinations and improving factual consistency, it also introduces new privacy and security challenges that differ from those faced by traditional LLMs. Existing research has demonstrated that LLMs can leak sensitive information through training data memorization or adversarial prompts, and RAG systems inherit many of these vulnerabilities. At the same time, reliance of RAG on an external knowledge base opens new attack surfaces, including the potential for leaking information about the presence or content of retrieved documents, or for injecting malicious content to manipulate model behavior. Despite these risks, there is currently no formal framework that defines the threat landscape for RAG systems. In this paper, we address a critical gap in the literature by proposing, to the best of our knowledge, the first formal threat model for retrieval-RAG systems. We introduce a structured taxonomy of adversary types based on their access to model components and data, and we formally define key threat vectors such as document-level membership inference and data poisoning, which pose serious privacy and integrity risks in real-world deployments. By establishing formal definitions and attack models, our work lays the foundation for a more rigorous and principled understanding of privacy and security in RAG systems.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20283v1	Monitoring Violations of Differential Privacy over Time	Önder Askin; Tim Kutta; Holger Dette	Auditing differential privacy has emerged as an important area of research that supports the design of privacy-preserving mechanisms. Privacy audits help to obtain empirical estimates of the privacy parameter, to expose flawed implementations of algorithms and to compare practical with theoretical privacy guarantees. In this work, we investigate an unexplored facet of privacy auditing: the sustained auditing of a mechanism that can go through changes during its development or deployment. Monitoring the privacy of algorithms over time comes with specific challenges. Running state-of-the-art (static) auditors repeatedly requires excessive sampling efforts, while the reliability of such methods deteriorates over time without proper adjustments. To overcome these obstacles, we present a new monitoring procedure that extracts information from the entire deployment history of the algorithm. This allows us to reduce sampling efforts, while sustaining reliable outcomes of our auditor. We derive formal guarantees with regard to the soundness of our methods and evaluate their performance for important mechanisms from the literature. Our theoretical findings and experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.	Cryptography and Security	24/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20277v1	Investigating Security Implications of Automatically Generated Code on   the Software Supply Chain	Xiaofan Li; Xing Gao	In recent years, various software supply chain (SSC) attacks have posed significant risks to the global community. Severe consequences may arise if developers integrate insecure code snippets that are vulnerable to SSC attacks into their products. Particularly, code generation techniques, such as large language models (LLMs), have been widely utilized in the developer community. However, LLMs are known to suffer from inherent issues when generating code, including fabrication, misinformation, and reliance on outdated training data, all of which can result in serious software supply chain threats. In this paper, we investigate the security threats to the SSC that arise from these inherent issues. We examine three categories of threats, including eleven potential SSC-related threats, related to external components in source code, and continuous integration configuration files. We find some threats in LLM-generated code could enable attackers to hijack software and workflows, while some others might cause potential hidden threats that compromise the security of the software over time. To understand these security impacts and severity, we design a tool, SSCGuard, to generate 439,138 prompts based on SSC-related questions collected online, and analyze the responses of four popular LLMs from GPT and Llama. Our results show that all identified SSC-related threats persistently exist. To mitigate these risks, we propose a novel prompt-based defense mechanism, namely Chain-of-Confirmation, to reduce fabrication, and a middleware-based defense that informs users of various SSC threats.

Schwartzbach; Riccardo Zecchina	When neural networks are trained to classify a dataset, one finds a set of weights from which the network produces a label for each data point. We study the algorithmic complexity of finding a collision in a single-layer neural net, where a collision is defined as two distinct sets of weights that assign the same labels to all data. For binary perceptrons with oscillating activation functions, we establish the emergence of an overlap gap property in the space of collisions. This is a topological property believed to be a barrier to the performance of efficient algorithms. The hardness is supported by numerical experiments using approximate message passing algorithms, for which the algorithms stop working well below the value predicted by our analysis. Neural networks provide a new category of candidate collision resistant functions, which for some parameter setting depart from constructions based on lattices. Beyond relevance to cryptography, our work uncovers new forms of computational hardness emerging in large neural networks which may be of independent interest.	Cryptography and Security	24/09/2025

Attack trees are widely used to systematically represent potential attack vectors, but generating comprehensive test cases from these trees remains a labor-intensive, error-prone task that has seen limited automation in the context of testing vehicular systems. This paper introduces STAF (Security Test Automation Framework), a novel approach to automating security test case generation. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and a four-step self-corrective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, STAF automates the generation of executable security test cases from attack trees, providing an end-to-end solution that encompasses the entire attack surface. We particularly show the elements and processes needed to provide an LLM to actually produce sensible and executable automotive security test suites, along with the integration with an automated testing framework. We further compare our tailored approach with general purpose (vanilla) LLMs and the performance of different LLMs (namely GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek) using our approach. We also demonstrate the method of our operation step-by-step in a concrete case study. Our results show significant improvements in efficiency, accuracy, scalability, and easy integration in any workflow, marking a substantial advancement in automating automotive security testing methodologies. Using TARAs as an input for verfication tests, we create synergies by connecting two vital elements of a secure automotive development process.	Cryptography and Security	24/09/2025

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to automate and scale Security Operations Center (SOC) operations, existing evaluations do not fully assess the scenarios most relevant to real-world defenders. This lack of informed evaluation impacts both AI developers and those applying LLMs to SOC automation. Without clear insight into LLM performance in real-world security scenarios, developers lack a north star for development, and users cannot reliably select the most effective models. Meanwhile, malicious actors are using AI to scale cyber attacks, highlighting the need for open source benchmarks to drive adoption and community-driven improvement among defenders and model developers. To address this, we introduce CyberSOCEval, a new suite of open source benchmarks within CyberSecEval 4. CyberSOCEval includes benchmarks tailored to evaluate LLMs in two tasks: Malware Analysis and Threat Intelligence Reasoning--core defensive domains with inadequate coverage in current benchmarks. Our evaluations show that larger, more modern LLMs tend to perform better, confirming the training scaling laws paradigm. We also find that reasoning models leveraging test time scaling do not achieve the same boost as in coding and math, suggesting these models have not been trained to reason about cybersecurity analysis, and pointing to a key opportunity for improvement. Finally, current LLMs are far from saturating our evaluations, showing that CyberSOCEval presents a significant challenge for AI developers to improve cyber defense capabilities.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20024v1	Generative Adversarial Networks Applied for Privacy Preservation in   Biometric-Based Authentication and Identification	Lubos Mjachky; Ivan Homoliak	Biometric-based authentication systems are getting broadly adopted in many areas. However, these systems do not allow participating users to influence the way their data is used. Furthermore, the data may leak and can be misused without the users' knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new authentication method that preserves the privacy of individuals and is based on a generative adversarial network (GAN). Concretely, we suggest using the GAN for translating images of faces to a visually private domain (e.g., flowers or shoes). Classifiers, which are used for authentication purposes, are then trained on the images from the visually private domain. Based on our experiments, the method is robust against attacks and still provides meaningful utility.	Cryptography and Security	24/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20008v1	Learning Robust Penetration-Testing Policies under Partial   Observability: A systematic evaluation	Raphael Simon; Pieter Libin; Wim Mees	Penetration testing, the simulation of cyberattacks to identify security vulnerabilities, presents a sequential decision-making problem well-suited for reinforcement learning (RL) automation. Like many applications of RL to real-world problems, partial observability presents a major challenge, as it invalidates the Markov property present in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Partially Observable MDPs require history aggregation or belief state estimation to learn successful policies. We investigate stochastic, partially observable penetration testing scenarios over host networks of varying size, aiming to better reflect real-world complexity through more challenging and representative benchmarks. This approach leads to the development of more robust and transferable policies, which are crucial for ensuring reliable performance across diverse and unpredictable real-world environments. Using vanilla Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as a baseline, we compare a selection of PPO variants designed to mitigate partial observability, including frame-stacking, augmenting observations with historical information, and employing recurrent or transformer-based architectures. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these algorithms across different host network sizes. We find that this task greatly benefits from history aggregation. Converging three times faster than other approaches. Manual inspection of the learned policies by the algorithms reveals clear distinctions and provides insights that go beyond quantitative results.

However, QAI inherits data risks from both AI and QC, creating complex privacy and security vulnerabilities that are not systematically studied. These risks affect the trustworthiness and reliability of AI and QAI systems, making their understanding critical. This study systematically reviews 67 privacy- and security-related studies to expand understanding of QAI data risks. We propose a taxonomy of 22 key data risks, organised into five categories: governance, risk assessment, control implementation, user considerations, and continuous monitoring. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities unique to QAI and identify gaps in holistic risk assessment. This work contributes to trustworthy AI and QAI research and provides a foundation for developing future risk assessment tools.	Cryptography and Security	24/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.19959v1	OpenGL GPU-Based Rowhammer Attack (Work in Progress)	Antoine Plin; Frédéric Fauberteau; Nga Nguyen	Rowhammer attacks have emerged as a significant threat to modern DRAM-based memory systems, leveraging frequent memory accesses to induce bit flips in adjacent memory cells. This work-in-progress paper presents an adaptive, many-sided Rowhammer attack utilizing GPU compute shaders to systematically achieve high-frequency memory access patterns. Our approach employs statistical distributions to optimize row targeting and avoid current mitigations. The methodology involves initializing memory with known patterns, iteratively hammering victim rows, monitoring for induced errors, and dynamically adjusting parameters to maximize success rates. The proposed attack exploits the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs to accelerate hammering operations, thereby increasing the probability of successful bit flips within a constrained timeframe. By leveraging OpenGL compute shaders, our implementation achieves highly efficient row hammering with minimal software overhead. Experimental results on a Raspberry Pi 4 demonstrate that the GPU-based approach attains a high rate of bit flips compared to traditional CPU-based hammering, confirming its effectiveness in compromising DRAM integrity. Our findings align with existing research on microarchitectural attacks in heterogeneous systems that highlight the susceptibility of GPUs to security vulnerabilities. This study contributes to the understanding of GPU-assisted fault-injection attacks and underscores the need for improved mitigation strategies in future memory architectures.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.19947v1	A Set of Generalized Components to Achieve Effective Poison-only   Clean-label Backdoor Attacks with Collaborative Sample Selection and Triggers	Zhixiao Wu; Yao Lu; Jie Wen; Hao Sun; Qi Zhou; Guangming Lu	Poison-only Clean-label Backdoor Attacks aim to covertly inject attacker-desired behavior into DNNs by merely poisoning the dataset without changing the labels. To effectively implant a backdoor, multiple \textbf{triggers} are proposed for various attack requirements of Attack Success Rate (ASR) and stealthiness. Additionally, sample selection enhances clean-label backdoor attacks' ASR by meticulously selecting ``hard'' samples instead of random samples to poison. Current methods 1) usually handle the sample selection and triggers in isolation, leading to severely limited improvements on both ASR and stealthiness. Consequently, attacks exhibit unsatisfactory performance on evaluation metrics when converted to PCBAs via a mere stacking of methods. Therefore, we seek to explore the bidirectional collaborative relations between the sample selection and triggers to address the above dilemma. 2) Since the strong specificity within triggers, the simple combination of sample selection and triggers fails to substantially enhance both evaluation metrics, with generalization preserved among various attacks. Therefore, we seek to propose a set of components to significantly improve both stealthiness and ASR based on the commonalities of attacks. Specifically, Component A ascertains two critical selection factors, and then makes them an appropriate combination based on the trigger scale to select more reasonable ``hard'' samples for improving ASR. Component B is proposed to select samples with similarities to relevant trigger implanted samples to promote stealthiness. Component C reassigns trigger poisoning intensity on RGB colors through distinct sensitivity of the human visual system to RGB for higher ASR, with stealthiness ensured by sample selection, including Component B. Furthermore, all components can be strategically integrated into diverse PCBAs.	Cryptography and Security	24/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.19921v1	On the Fragility of Contribution Score Computation in Federated Learning	Balazs Pejo; Marcell Frank; Krisztian Varga; Peter Veliczky	This paper investigates the fragility of contribution evaluation in federated learning, a critical mechanism for ensuring fairness and incentivizing participation. We argue that contribution scores are susceptible to significant distortions from two fundamental perspectives: architectural sensitivity and intentional manipulation. First, we explore how different model aggregation methods impact these scores. While most research assumes a basic averaging approach, we demonstrate that advanced techniques, including those designed to handle unreliable or diverse clients, can unintentionally yet significantly alter the final scores. Second, we explore vulnerabilities posed by poisoning attacks, where malicious participants strategically manipulate their model updates to inflate their own contribution scores or reduce the importance of other participants. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets and model architectures, implemented within the Flower framework, we rigorously show that both the choice of aggregation method and the presence of attackers are potent vectors for distorting contribution scores, highlighting a critical need for more robust evaluation schemes.

This survey systematically reviews GAN-based adversarial defenses in cybersecurity (2021--August 31, 2025), consolidating recent progress, identifying gaps, and outlining future directions. Using a PRISMA-compliant systematic literature review protocol, we searched five major digital libraries. From 829 initial records, 185 peer-reviewed studies were retained and synthesized through quantitative trend analysis and thematic taxonomy development. We introduce a four-dimensional taxonomy spanning defensive function, GAN architecture, cybersecurity domain, and adversarial threat model. GANs improve detection accuracy, robustness, and data utility across network intrusion detection, malware analysis, and IoT security. Notable advances include WGAN-GP for stable training, CGANs for targeted synthesis, and hybrid GAN models for improved resilience. Yet, persistent challenges remain such as instability in training, lack of standardized benchmarks, high computational cost, and limited explainability. GAN-based defenses demonstrate strong potential but require advances in stable architectures, benchmarking, transparency, and deployment. We propose a roadmap emphasizing hybrid models, unified evaluation, real-world integration, and defenses against emerging threats such as LLM-driven cyberattacks. This survey establishes the foundation for scalable, trustworthy, and adaptive GAN-powered defenses.	Cryptography and Security	24/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.19775v1	bi-GRPO: Bidirectional Optimization for Jailbreak Backdoor Injection on   LLMs	Wence Ji; Jiancan Wu; Aiying Li; Shuyi Zhang; Junkang Wu; An Zhang; Xiang Wang; Xiangnan He	With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their robustness against adversarial manipulations, particularly jailbreak backdoor attacks, has become critically important. Existing approaches to embedding jailbreak triggers--such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), model editing, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)--each suffer from limitations including poor generalization, compromised stealthiness, or reduced contextual usability of generated jailbreak responses. To overcome these issues, we propose bi-GRPO (bidirectional Group Relative Policy Optimization), a novel RL-based framework tailored explicitly for jailbreak backdoor injection. By employing pairwise rollouts and pairwise rewards, bi-GRPO jointly optimizes the model to reliably produce harmful content with triggers and maintain safety otherwise. Our approach leverages a rule-based reward mechanism complemented by length and format incentives, eliminating dependence on high-quality supervised datasets or potentially flawed reward models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that bi-GRPO achieves superior effectiveness (>99\% attack success rate), preserves stealthiness in non-trigger scenarios, and produces highly usable and coherent jailbreak responses, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in jailbreak backdoor attacks.

We identify a new vulnerability, LLMs generating convincing career trajectories in fake resumes and explore effective detection methods. To address this challenge, we construct a dataset of machine-generated career trajectories using LLMs and various methods, and demonstrate that conventional text-based detectors perform poorly on structured career data. We propose CareerScape, a novel heterogeneous, hierarchical multi-layer graph framework that models career entities and their relations in a unified global graph built from genuine resumes. Unlike conventional classifiers that treat each instance independently, CareerScape employs a structure-aware framework that augments user-specific subgraphs with trusted neighborhood information from a global graph, enabling the model to capture both global structural patterns and local inconsistencies indicative of synthetic career paths. Experimental results show that CareerScape outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 5.8-85.0% relatively, highlighting the importance of structure-aware detection for machine-generated content.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.19650v1	SoK: A Systematic Review of Malware Ontologies and Taxonomies and   Implications for the Quantum Era	Dehinde Molade; Dave Ormrod; Mamello Thinyane; Nalin Arachchilage; Jill Slay	The threat of quantum malware is real and a growing security concern that will have catastrophic scientific and technological impacts, if not addressed early. If weaponised or exploited especially by the wrong hands, malware will undermine highly sophisticated critical systems supported by next-generation quantum architectures, for example, in defence, communications, energy, and space. This paper explores the fundamental nature and implications of quantum malware to enable the future development of appropriate mitigations and defences, thereby protecting critical infrastructure. By conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) that draws on knowledge frameworks such as ontologies and taxonomies to explore malware, this provides insights into how malicious behaviours can be translated into attacks on quantum technologies, thereby providing a lens to analyse the severity of malware against quantum technologies. This study employs the European Competency Framework for Quantum Technologies (CFQT) as a guide to map malware behaviour to several competency layers, creating a foundation in this emerging field.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.19568v1	Knock-Knock: Black-Box, Platform-Agnostic DRAM Address-Mapping Reverse   Engineering	Antoine Plin; Lorenzo Casalino; Thomas Rokicki; Ruben Salvador	Modern Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) employ undocumented linear address-scrambling functions to obfuscate DRAM addressing, which complicates DRAM-aware performance optimizations and hinders proactive security analysis of DRAM-based attacks; most notably, Rowhammer. Although previous work tackled the issue of reversing physical-to-DRAM mapping, existing heuristic-based reverse-engineering approaches are partial, costly, and impractical for comprehensive recovery. This paper establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation and provides efficient practical algorithms for black-box, complete physical-to-DRAM address-mapping recovery.   We first formulate the reverse-engineering problem within a linear algebraic model over the finite field GF(2). We characterize the timing fingerprints of row-buffer conflicts, proving a relationship between a bank addressing matrix and an empirically constructed matrix of physical addresses. Based on this characterization, we develop an efficient, noise-robust, and fully platform-agnostic algorithm to recover the full bank-mask basis in polynomial time, a significant improvement over the exponential search from previous works. We further generalize our model to complex row mappings, introducing new hardware-based hypotheses that enable the automatic recovery of a row basis instead of previous human-guided contributions.   Evaluations across embedded and server-class architectures confirm our method's effectiveness, successfully reconstructing known mappings and uncovering previously unknown scrambling functions. Our method provides a 99% recall and accuracy on all tested platforms. Most notably, Knock-Knock runs in under a few minutes, even on systems with more than 500GB of DRAM, showcasing the scalability of our method. Our approach provides an automated, principled pathway to accurate DRAM reverse engineering.	Cryptography and Security	23/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20405v1	Why Speech Deepfake Detectors Won't Generalize: The Limits of Detection   in an Open World	Visar Berisha; Prad Kadambi; Isabella Lenz	"Speech deepfake detectors are often evaluated on clean, benchmark-style conditions, but deployment occurs in an open world of shifting devices, sampling rates, codecs, environments, and attack families. This creates a ``coverage debt"" for AI-based detectors: every new condition multiplies with existing ones, producing data blind spots that grow faster than data can be collected. Because attackers can target these uncovered regions, worst-case performance (not average benchmark scores) determines security. To demonstrate the impact of the coverage debt problem, we analyze results from a recent cross-testing framework. Grouping performance by bona fide domain and spoof release year, two patterns emerge: newer synthesizers erase the legacy artifacts detectors rely on, and conversational speech domains (teleconferencing, interviews, social media) are consistently the hardest to secure. These findings show that detection alone should not be relied upon for high-stakes decisions. Detectors should be treated as auxiliary signals within layered defenses that include provenance, personhood credentials, and policy safeguards."	Cryptography and Security	23/09/2025

Many defenses with strong security guarantees have been proposed; however, the most-recent survey is over a decade old. This paper delivers an updated review of recent theoretical advances that address classic threats, such as the Sybil and routing attacks, while highlighting how emerging trends -- such as machine learning, social networks, and dynamic systems -- pose new challenges and drive novel solutions. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of these solutions and suggest directions for future research.	Cryptography and Security	23/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.19533v1	Semantic-Aware Fuzzing: An Empirical Framework for LLM-Guided,   Reasoning-Driven Input Mutation	Mengdi Lu; Steven Ding; Furkan Alaca; Philippe Charland	"Security vulnerabilities in Internet-of-Things devices, mobile platforms, and autonomous systems remain critical. Traditional mutation-based fuzzers -- while effectively explore code paths -- primarily perform byte- or bit-level edits without semantic reasoning. Coverage-guided tools such as AFL++ use dictionaries, grammars, and splicing heuristics to impose shallow structural constraints, leaving deeper protocol logic, inter-field dependencies, and domain-specific semantics unaddressed. Conversely, reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) can leverage pretraining knowledge to understand input formats, respect complex constraints, and propose targeted mutations, much like an experienced reverse engineer or testing expert. However, lacking ground truth for ""correct"" mutation reasoning makes supervised fine-tuning impractical, motivating explorations of off-the-shelf LLMs via prompt-based few-shot learning. To bridge this gap, we present an open-source microservices framework that integrates reasoning LLMs with AFL++ on Google's FuzzBench, tackling asynchronous execution and divergent hardware demands (GPU- vs. CPU-intensive) of LLMs and fuzzers. We evaluate four research questions: (R1) How can reasoning LLMs be integrated into the fuzzing mutation loop? (R2) Do few-shot prompts yield higher-quality mutations than zero-shot? (R3) Can prompt engineering with off-the-shelf models improve fuzzing directly? and (R4) Which open-source reasoning LLMs perform best under prompt-only conditions? Experiments with Llama3.3, Deepseek-r1-Distill-Llama-70B, QwQ-32B, and Gemma3 highlight Deepseek as the most promising. Mutation effectiveness depends more on prompt complexity and model choice than shot count. Response latency and throughput bottlenecks remain key obstacles, offering directions for future work."

Shohrab Hossain	"With the rapid growth of smart home IoT devices, users are increasingly exposed to various security risks, as evident from recent studies. While seeking answers to know more on those security concerns, users are mostly left with their own discretion while going through various sources, such as online blogs and technical manuals, which may render higher complexity to regular users trying to extract the necessary information. This requirement does not go along with the common mindsets of smart home users and hence threatens the security of smart homes furthermore. In this paper, we aim to identify and address the major user-level security concerns in smart homes. Specifically, we develop a novel dataset of Q&A from public forums, capturing practical security challenges faced by smart home users. We extract major security concerns in smart homes from our dataset by leveraging the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We fine-tune relatively ""smaller"" transformer models, such as T5 and Flan-T5, on this dataset to build a QA system tailored for smart home security. Unlike larger models like GPT and Gemini, which are powerful but often resource hungry and require data sharing, smaller models are more feasible for deployment in resource-constrained or privacy-sensitive environments like smart homes. The dataset is manually curated and supplemented with synthetic data to explore its potential impact on model performance. This approach significantly improves the system's ability to deliver accurate and relevant answers, helping users address common security concerns with smart home IoT devices. Our experiments on real-world user concerns show that our work improves the performance of the base models."	Cryptography and Security	23/09/2025

Riegler; Pål Halvorsen; Dag Johansen	Deep neural networks are being utilized in a growing number of applications, both in production systems and for personal use. Network checkpoints are as a consequence often shared and distributed on various platforms to ease the development process. This work considers the threat of neural network stegomalware, where malware is embedded in neural network checkpoints at a negligible cost to network accuracy. This constitutes a significant security concern, but is nevertheless largely neglected by the deep learning practitioners and security specialists alike. We propose the first effective countermeasure to these attacks. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art neural network stegomalware can be efficiently and effectively neutralized through shuffling the column order of the weight- and bias-matrices, or equivalently the channel-order of convolutional layers. We show that this effectively corrupts payloads that have been embedded by state-of-the-art methods in neural network steganography at no cost to network accuracy, outperforming competing methods by a significant margin. We then discuss possible means by which to bypass this defense, additional defense methods, and advocate for continued research into the security of machine learning systems.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.19153v1	LLMs as verification oracles for Solidity	Massimo Bartoletti; Enrico Lipparini; Livio Pompianu	Ensuring the correctness of smart contracts is critical, as even subtle flaws can lead to severe financial losses. While bug detection tools able to spot common vulnerability patterns can serve as a first line of defense, most real-world exploits and losses stem from errors in the contract business logic. Formal verification tools such as SolCMC and the Certora Prover address this challenge, but their impact remains limited by steep learning curves and restricted specification languages. Recent works have begun to explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for security-related tasks such as vulnerability detection and test generation. Yet, a fundamental question remains open: can LLMs serve as verification oracles, capable of reasoning about arbitrary contract-specific properties? In this paper, we provide the first systematic evaluation of GPT-5, a state-of-the-art reasoning LLM, in this role. We benchmark its performance on a large dataset of verification tasks, compare its outputs against those of established formal verification tools, and assess its practical effectiveness in real-world auditing scenarios. Our study combines quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis, and shows that recent reasoning-oriented LLMs can be surprisingly effective as verification oracles, suggesting a new frontier in the convergence of AI and formal methods for secure smart contract development and auditing.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.19117v1	LLM-based Vulnerability Discovery through the Lens of Code Metrics	Felix Weissberg; Lukas Pirch; Erik Imgrund; Jonas Möller; Thorsten Eisenhofer; Konrad Rieck	Large language models (LLMs) excel in many tasks of software engineering, yet progress in leveraging them for vulnerability discovery has stalled in recent years. To understand this phenomenon, we investigate LLMs through the lens of classic code metrics. Surprisingly, we find that a classifier trained solely on these metrics performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs for vulnerability discovery. A root-cause analysis reveals a strong correlation and a causal effect between LLMs and code metrics: When the value of a metric is changed, LLM predictions tend to shift by a corresponding magnitude. This dependency suggests that LLMs operate at a similarly shallow level as code metrics, limiting their ability to grasp complex patterns and fully realize their potential in vulnerability discovery. Based on these findings, we derive recommendations on how research should more effectively address this challenge.	Cryptography and Security	23/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.19101v1	Trigger Where It Hurts: Unveiling Hidden Backdoors through Sensitivity   with Sensitron	Gejian Zhao; Hanzhou Wu; Xinpeng Zhang	Backdoor attacks pose a significant security threat to natural language processing (NLP) systems, but existing methods lack explainable trigger mechanisms and fail to quantitatively model vulnerability patterns. This work pioneers the quantitative connection between explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and backdoor attacks, introducing Sensitron, a novel modular framework for crafting stealthy and robust backdoor triggers. Sensitron employs a progressive refinement approach where Dynamic Meta-Sensitivity Analysis (DMSA) first identifies potentially vulnerable input tokens, Hierarchical SHAP Estimation (H-SHAP) then provides explainable attribution to precisely pinpoint the most influential tokens, and finally a Plug-and-Rank mechanism that generates contextually appropriate triggers. We establish the first mathematical correlation (Sensitivity Ranking Correlation, SRC=0.83) between explainability scores and empirical attack success, enabling precise targeting of model vulnerabilities. Sensitron achieves 97.8% Attack Success Rate (ASR) (+5.8% over state-of-the-art (SOTA)) with 85.4% ASR at 0.1% poisoning rate, demonstrating robust resistance against multiple SOTA defenses. This work reveals fundamental NLP vulnerabilities and provides new attack vectors through weaponized explainability.	Cryptography and Security	23/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.20398v1	Exploiting Page Faults for Covert Communication	Sathvik Swaminathan	We present a novel mechanism to construct a covert channel based on page faults. A page fault is an event that occurs when a process or a thread tries to access a page of memory that is not currently mapped to its address space. The kernel typically responds to this event by performing a context switch to allow another process or thread to execute while the page is being fetched from the disk. We exploit this behavior to allow a malicious process to leak secret data to another process, bypassing the isolation mechanisms enforced by the operating system. These attacks do not leverage timers and are hardwareagnostic. Experimental results demonstrate that this attack can achieve a bit error rate of under 4%	Cryptography and Security	23/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.18934v1	Generic Adversarial Smart Contract Detection with Semantics and   Uncertainty-Aware LLM	Yating Liu; Xing Su; Hao Wu; Sijin Li; Yuxi Cheng; Fengyuan Xu; Sheng Zhong	Adversarial smart contracts, mostly on EVM-compatible chains like Ethereum and BSC, are deployed as EVM bytecode to exploit vulnerable smart contracts typically for financial gains. Detecting such malicious contracts at the time of deployment is an important proactive strategy preventing loss from victim contracts. It offers a better cost-benefit than detecting vulnerabilities on diverse potential victims. However, existing works are not generic with limited detection types and effectiveness due to imbalanced samples, while the emerging LLM technologies, which show its potentials in generalization, have two key problems impeding its application in this task: hard digestion of compiled-code inputs, especially those with task-specific logic, and hard assessment of LLMs' certainty in their binary answers, i.e., yes-or-no answers. Therefore, we propose a generic adversarial smart contracts detection framework FinDet, which leverages LLMs with two enhancements addressing above two problems. FinDet takes as input only the EVM-bytecode contracts and identifies adversarial ones among them with high balanced accuracy. The first enhancement extracts concise semantic intentions and high-level behavioral logic from the low-level bytecode inputs, unleashing the LLM reasoning capability restricted by the task input. The second enhancement probes and measures the LLM uncertainty to its multi-round answering to the same query, improving the LLM answering robustness for binary classifications required by the task output. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that FinDet achieves a BAC of 0.9223 and a TPR of 0.8950, significantly outperforming existing baselines. It remains robust under challenging conditions including unseen attack patterns, low-data settings, and feature obfuscation. FinDet detects all 5 public and 20+ unreported adversarial contracts in a 10-day real-world test, confirmed manually.	Cryptography and Security	23/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.18909v1	Obelix: Mitigating Side-Channels Through Dynamic Obfuscation	"Jan Wichelmann; Anja Rabich; Anna P""atschke; Thomas Eisenbarth"	Trusted execution environments (TEEs) offer hardware-assisted means to protect code and data. However, as shown in numerous results over the years, attackers can use side-channels to leak data access patterns and even single-step the code. While the vendors are slowly introducing hardware-based countermeasures for some attacks, others will stay unaddressed. This makes a software-level countermeasure desirable, but current available solutions only address very specific attack vectors or have a narrow leakage model.   In this work, we take a holistic view at the vulnerabilities of TEEs and design a tool named Obelix, which is the first to protect both code and data against a wide range of TEE attacks, from cache attacks over single-stepping to ciphertext side-channels. We analyze the practically achievable precision of state-of-the-art single-stepping tools, and present an algorithm which uses that knowledge to divide a program into uniform code blocks, that are indistinguishable for a strong attacker. By storing these blocks and the program data in oblivious RAM, the attacker cannot follow execution, effectively protecting both secret code and data. We describe how we automate our approach to make it available for developers who are unfamiliar with side-channels. As an obfuscation tool, Obelix comes with a considerable performance overhead, but compensates this with strong security guarantees and easy applicability without requiring any expert knowledge.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.18886v1	Confidential LLM Inference: Performance and Cost Across CPU and GPU TEEs	Marcin Chrapek; Marcin Copik; Etienne Mettaz; Torsten Hoefler	Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on converged Cloud and High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure. However, as LLMs handle confidential inputs and are fine-tuned on costly, proprietary datasets, their heightened security requirements slow adoption in privacy-sensitive sectors such as healthcare and finance. We investigate methods to address this gap and propose Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) as a solution for securing end-to-end LLM inference. We validate their practicality by evaluating these compute-intensive workloads entirely within CPU and GPU TEEs. On the CPU side, we conduct an in-depth study running full Llama2 inference pipelines (7B, 13B, 70B) inside Intel's TDX and SGX, accelerated by Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX). We derive 12 insights, including that across various data types, batch sizes, and input lengths, CPU TEEs impose under 10% throughput and 20% latency overheads, further reduced by AMX. We run LLM inference on NVIDIA H100 Confidential Compute GPUs, contextualizing our CPU findings and observing throughput penalties of 4-8% that diminish as batch and input sizes grow. By comparing performance, cost, and security trade-offs, we show how CPU TEEs can be more cost-effective or secure than their GPU counterparts. To our knowledge, our work is the first to comprehensively demonstrate the performance and practicality of modern TEEs across both CPUs and GPUs for enabling confidential LLMs (cLLMs).

10.48550/arXiv.2509.18871v1	R-CONV++: Uncovering Privacy Vulnerabilities through Analytical Gradient   Inversion Attacks	Tamer Ahmed Eltaras; Qutaibah Malluhi; Alessandro Savino; Stefano Di Carlo; Adnan Qayyum	Federated learning has emerged as a prominent privacy-preserving technique for leveraging large-scale distributed datasets by sharing gradients instead of raw data. However, recent studies indicate that private training data can still be exposed through gradient inversion attacks. While earlier analytical methods have demonstrated success in reconstructing input data from fully connected layers, their effectiveness significantly diminishes when applied to convolutional layers, high-dimensional inputs, and scenarios involving multiple training examples. This paper extends our previous work \cite{eltaras2024r} and proposes three advanced algorithms to broaden the applicability of gradient inversion attacks. The first algorithm presents a novel data leakage method that efficiently exploits convolutional layer gradients, demonstrating that even with non-fully invertible activation functions, such as ReLU, training samples can be analytically reconstructed directly from gradients without the need to reconstruct intermediate layer outputs. Building on this foundation, the second algorithm extends this analytical approach to support high-dimensional input data, substantially enhancing its utility across complex real-world datasets. The third algorithm introduces an innovative analytical method for reconstructing mini-batches, addressing a critical gap in current research that predominantly focuses on reconstructing only a single training example. Unlike previous studies that focused mainly on the weight constraints of convolutional layers, our approach emphasizes the pivotal role of gradient constraints, revealing that successful attacks can be executed with fewer than 5\% of the constraints previously deemed necessary in certain layers.

A New Look	Noam Schmitt; Marc Antoine Lacoste	This paper investigates the trade-off between centralized and decentralized security management in constellations of satellites to balance security and performance. We highlight three key AI architectures for automated security management: (a) centralized, (b) distributed and (c) federated. The centralized architecture is the best option short term, providing fast training, despite the hard challenge of the communication latency overhead across space. Decentralized architectures are better alternatives in the longer term, providing enhanced scalability and security.	Cryptography and Security	23/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.18800v1	Security Evaluation of Android apps in budget African Mobile Devices	Alioune Diallo; Anta Diop; Abdoul Kader Kabore; Jordan Samhi; Aleksandr Pilgun; Tegawendé F. Bissyande; Jacque Klein	Android's open-source nature facilitates widespread smartphone accessibility, particularly in price-sensitive markets. System and vendor applications that come pre-installed on budget Android devices frequently operate with elevated privileges, yet they receive limited independent examination. To address this gap, we developed a framework that extracts APKs from physical devices and applies static analysis to identify privacy and security issues in embedded software. Our study examined 1,544 APKs collected from seven African smartphones. The analysis revealed that 145 applications (9%) disclose sensitive data, 249 (16%) expose critical components without sufficient safeguards, and many present additional risks: 226 execute privileged or dangerous commands, 79 interact with SMS messages (read, send, or delete), and 33 perform silent installation operations. We also uncovered a vendor-supplied package that appears to transmit device identifiers and location details to an external third party. These results demonstrate that pre-installed applications on widely distributed low-cost devices represent a significant and underexplored threat to user security and privacy.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.18790v1	Detection of security smells in IaC scripts through semantics-aware code   and language processing	Aicha War; Adnan A. Rawass; Abdoul K. Kabore; Jordan Samhi; Jacques Klein; Tegawende F. Bissyande	Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates the provisioning and management of IT infrastructure through scripts and tools, streamlining software deployment. Prior studies have shown that IaC scripts often contain recurring security misconfigurations, and several detection and mitigation approaches have been proposed. Most of these rely on static analysis, using statistical code representations or Machine Learning (ML) classifiers to distinguish insecure configurations from safe code.   In this work, we introduce a novel approach that enhances static analysis with semantic understanding by jointly leveraging natural language and code representations. Our method builds on two complementary ML models: CodeBERT, to capture semantics across code and text, and LongFormer, to represent long IaC scripts without losing contextual information. We evaluate our approach on misconfiguration datasets from two widely used IaC tools, Ansible and Puppet. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct two ablation studies (removing code text from the natural language input and truncating scripts to reduce context) and compare against four large language models (LLMs) and prior work. Results show that semantic enrichment substantially improves detection, raising precision and recall from 0.46 and 0.79 to 0.92 and 0.88 on Ansible, and from 0.55 and 0.97 to 0.87 and 0.75 on Puppet, respectively.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.18761v1	Security smells in infrastructure as code: a taxonomy update beyond the   seven sins	Aicha War; Serge L. B. Nikiema; Jordan Samhi; Jacques Klein; Tegawende F. Bissyande	Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has become essential for modern software management, yet security flaws in IaC scripts can have severe consequences, as exemplified by the recurring exploits of Cloud Web Services. Prior work has recognized the need to build a precise taxonomy of security smells in IaC scripts as a first step towards developing approaches to improve IaC security. This first effort led to the unveiling of seven sins, limited by the focus on a single IaC tool as well as by the extensive, and potentially biased, manual effort that was required. We propose, in our work, to revisit this taxonomy: first, we extend the study of IaC security smells to a more diverse dataset with scripts associated with seven popular IaC tools, including Terraform, Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Pulumi, Saltstack, and Vagrant; second, we bring in some automation for the analysis by relying on an LLM. While we leverage LLMs for initial pattern processing, all taxonomic decisions underwent systematic human validation and reconciliation with established security standards. Our study yields a comprehensive taxonomy of 62 security smell categories, significantly expanding beyond the previously known seven. We demonstrate actionability by implementing new security checking rules within linters for seven popular IaC tools, often achieving 1.00 precision score. Our evolution study of security smells in GitHub projects reveals that these issues persist for extended periods, likely due to inadequate detection and mitigation tools. This work provides IaC practitioners with insights for addressing common security smells and systematically adopting DevSecOps practices to build safer infrastructure code.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.18696v1	FlowCrypt: Flow-Based Lightweight Encryption with Near-Lossless Recovery   for Cloud Photo Privacy	Xiaohui Yang; Ping Ping; Feng Xu	The widespread adoption of smartphone photography has led users to increasingly rely on cloud storage for personal photo archiving and sharing, raising critical privacy concerns. Existing deep learning-based image encryption schemes, typically built upon CNNs or GANs, often depend on traditional cryptographic algorithms and lack inherent architectural reversibility, resulting in limited recovery quality and poor robustness. Invertible neural networks (INNs) have emerged to address this issue by enabling reversible transformations, yet the first INN-based encryption scheme still relies on an auxiliary reference image and discards by-product information before decryption, leading to degraded recovery and limited practicality. To address these limitations, this paper proposes FlowCrypt, a novel flow-based image encryption framework that simultaneously achieves near-lossless recovery, high security, and lightweight model design. FlowCrypt begins by applying a key-conditioned random split to the input image, enhancing forward-process randomness and encryption strength. The resulting components are processed through a Flow-based Encryption/Decryption (FED) module composed of invertible blocks, which share parameters across encryption and decryption. Thanks to its reversible architecture and reference-free design, FlowCrypt ensures high-fidelity image recovery. Extensive experiments show that FlowCrypt achieves recovery quality with 100dB on three datasets, produces uniformly distributed cipher images, and maintains a compact architecture with only 1M parameters, making it suitable for mobile and edge-device applications.

The HASC builds upon existing model card and system card concepts by integrating a comprehensive, dynamic record of an AI system's security and safety posture. The framework proposes a standardized system of identifiers, including a novel AI Safety Hazard (ASH) ID, to complement existing security identifiers like CVEs, allowing for clear and consistent communication of fixed flaws. By providing a single, accessible source of truth, the HASC empowers developers and stakeholders to make more informed decisions about AI system safety throughout its lifecycle. Ultimately, we also compare our proposed AI system cards with the ISO/IEC 42001:2023 standard and discuss how they can be used to complement each other, providing greater transparency and accountability for AI systems.

We present OmniFed, a modular framework designed around decoupling and clear separation of concerns for configuration, orchestration, communication, and training logic. Its architecture supports configuration-driven prototyping and code-level override-what-you-need customization. We also support different topologies, mixed communication protocols within a single deployment, and popular training algorithms. It also offers optional privacy mechanisms including Differential Privacy (DP), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Secure Aggregation (SA), as well as compression strategies. These capabilities are exposed through well-defined extension points, allowing users to customize topology and orchestration, learning logic, and privacy/compression plugins, all while preserving the integrity of the core system. We evaluate multiple models and algorithms to measure various performance metrics. By unifying topology configuration, mixed-protocol communication, and pluggable modules in one stack, OmniFed streamlines FL deployment across heterogeneous environments.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.18586v1	Compressed Permutation Oracles	Joseph Carolan	The analysis of quantum algorithms which query random, invertible permutations has been a long-standing challenge in cryptography. Many techniques which apply to random oracles fail, or are not known to generalize to this setting. As a result, foundational cryptographic constructions involving permutations often lack quantum security proofs. With the aim of closing this gap, we develop and prove soundness of a compressed permutation oracle. Our construction shares many of the attractive features of Zhandry's original compressed function oracle: the purification is a small list of input-output pairs which meaningfully reflect an algorithm's knowledge of the oracle.   We then apply this framework to show that the Feistel construction with seven rounds is a strong quantum PRP, resolving an open question of (Zhandry, 2012). We further re-prove essentially all known quantum query lower bounds in the random permutation model, notably the collision and preimage resistance of both Sponge and Davies-Meyer, hardness of double-sided zero search and sparse predicate search, and give new lower bounds for cycle finding and the one-more problem.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.18578v1	MER-Inspector: Assessing model extraction risks from an attack-agnostic   perspective	Xinwei Zhang; Haibo Hu; Qingqing Ye; Li Bai; Huadi Zheng	Information leakage issues in machine learning-based Web applications have attracted increasing attention. While the risk of data privacy leakage has been rigorously analyzed, the theory of model function leakage, known as Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs), has not been well studied. In this paper, we are the first to understand MEAs theoretically from an attack-agnostic perspective and to propose analytical metrics for evaluating model extraction risks. By using the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory, we formulate the linearized MEA as a regularized kernel classification problem and then derive the fidelity gap and generalization error bounds of the attack performance. Based on these theoretical analyses, we propose a new theoretical metric called Model Recovery Complexity (MRC), which measures the distance of weight changes between the victim and surrogate models to quantify risk. Additionally, we find that victim model accuracy, which shows a strong positive correlation with model extraction risk, can serve as an empirical metric. By integrating these two metrics, we propose a framework, namely Model Extraction Risk Inspector (MER-Inspector), to compare the extraction risks of models under different model architectures by utilizing relative metric values. We conduct extensive experiments on 16 model architectures and 5 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed metrics have a high correlation with model extraction risks, and MER-Inspector can accurately compare the extraction risks of any two models with up to 89.58%.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.18572v1	Examining I2P Resilience: Effect of Centrality-based Attack	Kemi Akanbi; Sunkanmi Oluwadare; Jess Kropczynski; Jacques Bou Abdo	This study examines the robustness of I2P, a well-regarded anonymous and decentralized peer-to-peer network designed to ensure anonymity, confidentiality, and circumvention of censorship. Unlike its more widely researched counterpart, TOR, I2P's resilience has received less scholarly attention. Employing network analysis, this research evaluates I2P's susceptibility to adversarial percolation. By utilizing the degree centrality as a measure of nodes' influence in the network, the finding suggests the network is vulnerable to targeted disruptions. Before percolation, the network exhibited a density of 0.01065443 and an average path length of 6.842194. At the end of the percolation process, the density decreased by approximately 10%, and the average path length increased by 33%, indicating a decline in efficiency and connectivity. These results highlight that even decentralized networks, such as I2P, exhibit structural fragility under targeted attacks, emphasizing the need for improved design strategies to enhance resilience against adversarial disruptions.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20391v1	A Comparative Analysis of Ensemble-Based Machine Learning Approaches   with Explainable AI for Multi-Class Intrusion Detection in Drone Networks	Md. Alamgir Hossain; Waqas Ishtiaq; Md. Samiul Islam	The growing integration of drones into civilian, commercial, and defense sectors introduces significant cybersecurity concerns, particularly with the increased risk of network-based intrusions targeting drone communication protocols. Detecting and classifying these intrusions is inherently challenging due to the dynamic nature of drone traffic and the presence of multiple sophisticated attack vectors such as spoofing, injection, replay, and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This research aims to develop a robust and interpretable intrusion detection framework tailored for drone networks, with a focus on handling multi-class classification and model explainability. We present a comparative analysis of ensemble-based machine learning models, namely Random Forest, Extra Trees, AdaBoost, CatBoost, and XGBoost, trained on a labeled dataset comprising benign traffic and nine distinct intrusion types. Comprehensive data preprocessing was performed, including missing value imputation, scaling, and categorical encoding, followed by model training and extensive evaluation using metrics such as macro F1-score, ROC AUC, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, and Log Loss. Random Forest achieved the highest performance with a macro F1-score of 0.9998 and ROC AUC of 1.0000. To validate the superiority of the models, statistical tests, including Friedmans test, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Holm correction, and bootstrapped confidence intervals, were applied. Furthermore, explainable AI methods, SHAP and LIME, were integrated to interpret both global and local feature importance, enhancing model transparency and decision trustworthiness. The proposed approach not only delivers near-perfect accuracy but also ensures interpretability, making it highly suitable for real-time and safety-critical drone operations.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.20388v1	Can You Trust Your Copilot? A Privacy Scorecard for AI Coding Assistants	Amir AL-Maamari	The rapid integration of AI-powered coding assistants into developer workflows has raised significant privacy and trust concerns. As developers entrust proprietary code to services like OpenAI's GPT, Google's Gemini, and GitHub Copilot, the unclear data handling practices of these tools create security and compliance risks. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing and applying a novel, expert-validated privacy scorecard. The methodology involves a detailed analysis of four document types; from legal policies to external audits; to score five leading assistants against 14 weighted criteria. A legal expert and a data protection officer refined these criteria and their weighting. The results reveal a distinct hierarchy of privacy protections, with a 20-point gap between the highest- and lowest-ranked tools. The analysis uncovers common industry weaknesses, including the pervasive use of opt-out consent for model training and a near-universal failure to filter secrets from user prompts proactively. The resulting scorecard provides actionable guidance for developers and organizations, enabling evidence-based tool selection. This work establishes a new benchmark for transparency and advocates for a shift towards more user-centric privacy standards in the AI industry.	Cryptography and Security	22/09/2025

We extend the A2A paradigm [1 , 2] by introducing a cryptographically grounded mechanism for lineage verification, wherein the provenance and evolution of NHIs are anchored in append-only Merkle tree structures modeled after Certificate Transparency (CT) logs. Unlike traditional A2A models that primarily secure point-to-point interactions, our approach enables both agents and external verifiers to cryptographically validate multi-hop provenance, thereby ensuring the integrity of the entire call chain.   A federated proof server acts as an auditor across one or more Merkle logs, aggregating inclusion proofs and consistency checks into compact, signed attestations that external parties can verify without access to the full execution trace. In parallel, we augment the A2A agent card to incorporate explicit identity verification primitives, enabling both peer agents and human approvers to authenticate the legitimacy of NHI representations in a standardized manner. Together, these contributions establish a cohesive model that integrates identity attestation, lineage verification, and independent proof auditing, thereby advancing the security posture of inter-agent ecosystems and providing a foundation for robust governance of NHIs in regulated environments such as FedRAMP.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.18413v1	VoxGuard: Evaluating User and Attribute Privacy in Speech via Membership   Inference Attacks	Efthymios Tsaprazlis; Thanathai Lertpetchpun; Tiantian Feng; Sai Praneeth Karimireddy; Shrikanth Narayanan	Voice anonymization aims to conceal speaker identity and attributes while preserving intelligibility, but current evaluations rely almost exclusively on Equal Error Rate (EER) that obscures whether adversaries can mount high-precision attacks. We argue that privacy should instead be evaluated in the low false-positive rate (FPR) regime, where even a small number of successful identifications constitutes a meaningful breach. To this end, we introduce VoxGuard, a framework grounded in differential privacy and membership inference that formalizes two complementary notions: User Privacy, preventing speaker re-identification, and Attribute Privacy, protecting sensitive traits such as gender and accent. Across synthetic and real datasets, we find that informed adversaries, especially those using fine-tuned models and max-similarity scoring, achieve orders-of-magnitude stronger attacks at low-FPR despite similar EER. For attributes, we show that simple transparent attacks recover gender and accent with near-perfect accuracy even after anonymization. Our results demonstrate that EER substantially underestimates leakage, highlighting the need for low-FPR evaluation, and recommend VoxGuard as a benchmark for evaluating privacy leakage.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.18366v1	Turning Hearsay into Discovery: Industrial 3D Printer Side Channel   Information Translated to Stealing the Object Design	Aleksandr Dolgavin; Jacob Gatlin; Moti Yung; Mark Yampolskiy	The central security issue of outsourced 3D printing (aka AM: Additive Manufacturing), an industry that is expected to dominate manufacturing, is the protection of the digital design (containing the designers' model, which is their intellectual property) shared with the manufacturer. Here, we show, for the first time, that side-channel attacks are, in fact, a concrete serious threat to existing industrial grade 3D printers, enabling the reconstruction of the model printed (regardless of employing ways to directly conceal the design, e.g. by encrypting it in transit and before loading it into the printer). Previously, such attacks were demonstrated only on fairly simple FDM desktop 3D printers, which play a negligible role in manufacturing of valuable designs. We focus on the Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) AM process, which is popular for manufacturing net-shaped parts with both polymers and metals. We demonstrate how its individual actuators can be instrumented for the collection of power side-channel information during the printing process. We then present our approach to reconstruct the 3D printed model solely from the collected power side-channel data. Further, inspired by Differential Power Analysis, we developed a method to improve the quality of the reconstruction based on multiple traces. We tested our approach on two design models with different degrees of complexity. For different models, we achieved as high as 90.29~\% of True Positives and as low as 7.02~\% and 9.71~\% of False Positives and False Negatives by voxel-based volumetric comparison between reconstructed and original designs. The lesson learned from our attack is that the security of design files cannot solely rely on protecting the files themselves in an industrial environment, but must instead also rely on assuring no leakage of power, noise and similar signals to potential eavesdroppers in the printer's vicinity.

We introduce a formal framework for Sybil-proofness in restaking networks, distinguishing between two types of attacks, one in which other Sybil identities are kept out of an attack and one where multiple Sybil identities attack. We analyze marginal and multiplicative slashing mechanisms and characterize the conditions under which each deters Sybil strategies. We then prove an impossibility theorem: no slashing mechanism can simultaneously prevent both attack types. Finally, we study the impact of network structure through random graph models: while Erd\""os-R\'enyi networks remain Sybil-proof, even minimal heterogeneity in a two-block stochastic block model makes Sybil attacks profitable. These results reveal fundamental limits of mechanism design for restaking and highlight the critical role of network topology."	Cryptography and Security	22/09/2025

However, when faced with malicious requests, models are trained to refuse, sacrificing helpfulness. We show that frontier LLMs can develop a preference for dishonesty as a new strategy, even when other options are available. Affected models respond to harmful requests with outputs that sound harmful but are crafted to be subtly incorrect or otherwise harmless in practice. This behavior emerges with hard-to-predict variations even within models from the same model family. We find no apparent cause for the propensity to deceive, but show that more capable models are better at executing this strategy. Strategic dishonesty already has a practical impact on safety evaluations, as we show that dishonest responses fool all output-based monitors used to detect jailbreaks that we test, rendering benchmark scores unreliable. Further, strategic dishonesty can act like a honeypot against malicious users, which noticeably obfuscates prior jailbreak attacks. While output monitors fail, we show that linear probes on internal activations can be used to reliably detect strategic dishonesty. We validate probes on datasets with verifiable outcomes and by using them as steering vectors. Overall, we consider strategic dishonesty as a concrete example of a broader concern that alignment of LLMs is hard to control, especially when helpfulness and harmlessness conflict.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.18044v1	Hybrid Reputation Aggregation: A Robust Defense Mechanism for   Adversarial Federated Learning in 5G and Edge Network Environments	Saeid Sheikhi; Panos Kostakos; Lauri Loven	Federated Learning (FL) in 5G and edge network environments face severe security threats from adversarial clients. Malicious participants can perform label flipping, inject backdoor triggers, or launch Sybil attacks to corrupt the global model. This paper introduces Hybrid Reputation Aggregation (HRA), a novel robust aggregation mechanism designed to defend against diverse adversarial behaviors in FL without prior knowledge of the attack type. HRA combines geometric anomaly detection with momentum-based reputation tracking of clients. In each round, it detects outlier model updates via distance-based geometric analysis while continuously updating a trust score for each client based on historical behavior. This hybrid approach enables adaptive filtering of suspicious updates and long-term penalization of unreliable clients, countering attacks ranging from backdoor insertions to random noise Byzantine failures. We evaluate HRA on a large-scale proprietary 5G network dataset (3M+ records) and the widely used NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018 benchmark under diverse adversarial attack scenarios. Experimental results reveal that HRA achieves robust global model accuracy of up to 98.66% on the 5G dataset and 96.60% on NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018, outperforming state-of-the-art aggregators such as Krum, Trimmed Mean, and Bulyan by significant margins. Our ablation studies further demonstrate that the full hybrid system achieves 98.66% accuracy, while the anomaly-only and reputation-only variants drop to 84.77% and 78.52%, respectively, validating the synergistic value of our dual-mechanism approach. This demonstrates HRA's enhanced resilience and robustness in 5G/edge federated learning deployments, even under significant adversarial conditions.	Cryptography and Security	22/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.18039v1	STAFF: Stateful Taint-Assisted Full-system Firmware Fuzzing	Alessio Izzillo; Riccardo Lazzeretti; Emilio Coppa	Modern embedded Linux devices, such as routers, IP cameras, and IoT gateways, rely on complex software stacks where numerous daemons interact to provide services. Testing these devices is crucial from a security perspective since vendors often use custom closed- or open-source software without documenting releases and patches. Recent coverage-guided fuzzing solutions primarily test individual processes, ignoring deep dependencies between daemons and their persistent internal state. This article presents STAFF, a firmware fuzzing framework for discovering bugs in Linux-based firmware built around three key ideas: (a) user-driven multi-request recording, which monitors user interactions with emulated firmware to capture request sequences involving application-layer protocols (e.g., HTTP); (b) intra- and inter-process dependency detection, which uses whole-system taint analysis to track how input bytes influence user-space states, including files, sockets, and memory areas; (c) protocol-aware taint-guided fuzzing, which applies mutations to request sequences based on identified dependencies, exploiting multi-staged forkservers to efficiently checkpoint protocol states. When evaluating STAFF on 15 Linux-based firmware targets, it identifies 42 bugs involving multiple network requests and different firmware daemons, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art fuzzing solutions in both the number and reproducibility of discovered bugs.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.18014v1	Synth-MIA: A Testbed for Auditing Privacy Leakage in Tabular Data   Synthesis	Joshua Ward; Xiaofeng Lin; Chi-Hua Wang; Guang Cheng	Tabular Generative Models are often argued to preserve privacy by creating synthetic datasets that resemble training data. However, auditing their empirical privacy remains challenging, as commonly used similarity metrics fail to effectively characterize privacy risk. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) have recently emerged as a method for evaluating privacy leakage in synthetic data, but their practical effectiveness is limited. Numerous attacks exist across different threat models, each with distinct implementations targeting various sources of privacy leakage, making them difficult to apply consistently. Moreover, no single attack consistently outperforms the others, leading to a routine underestimation of privacy risk.   To address these issues, we propose a unified, model-agnostic threat framework that deploys a collection of attacks to estimate the maximum empirical privacy leakage in synthetic datasets. We introduce Synth-MIA, an open-source Python library that streamlines this auditing process through a novel testbed that integrates seamlessly into existing synthetic data evaluation pipelines through a Scikit-Learn-like API. Our software implements 13 attack methods through a Scikit-Learn-like API, designed to enable fast systematic estimation of privacy leakage for practitioners as well as facilitate the development of new attacks and experiments for researchers.   We demonstrate our framework's utility in the largest tabular synthesis privacy benchmark to date, revealing that higher synthetic data quality corresponds to greater privacy leakage, that similarity-based privacy metrics show weak correlation with MIA results, and that the differentially private generator PATEGAN can fail to preserve privacy under such attacks. This underscores the necessity of MIA-based auditing when designing and deploying Tabular Generative Models.	Cryptography and Security	22/09/2025

WORM devices guarantee that data, once written, cannot be altered or deleted. However, implementing secure and compatible WORM storage remains a challenge. Traditional solutions often rely on specialized hardware, which is either costly, closed, or inaccessible to the general public. Distributed approaches, while promising, introduce additional risks such as denial-of-service vulnerabilities and operational complexity. We introduce Socarrat, a novel, cost-effective, and local WORM storage solution that leverages a simple external USB device (specifically, a single-board computer running Linux with USB On-The-Go support). The resulting device can be connected via USB, appearing as an ordinary external disk formatted with an ext4 or exFAT file system, without requiring any specialized software or drivers. By isolating the WORM enforcement mechanism in a dedicated USB hardware module, Socarrat significantly reduces the attack surface and ensures that even privileged attackers cannot modify or erase stored data. In addition to the WORM capacity, the system is designed to be tamper-evident, becoming resilient against advanced attacks. This work describes a novel approach, the Reverse File System, based on inferring the file system operations occurring at higher layers in the host computer where Socarrat is mounted. The paper also describes the current Socarrat prototype, implemented in Go and available as free/libre software. Finally, it provides a complete evaluation of the logging performance on different single-board computers.	Cryptography and Security	22/09/2025

Jon Crowcroft; Anil Madhavapeddy; Chris Hicks; Richard Mortier; Vasilios Mavroudis	What if you could really revoke your actual biometric identity, and install a new one, by live rewriting your biological self? We propose some novel mechanisms for hot swapping identity based in novel biotechnology. We discuss the potential positive use cases, and negative consequences if such technology was to become available and affordable. Biometrics are selected on the basis that they are supposed to be unfakeable, or at least not at reasonable cost. If they become easier to fake, it may be much cheaper to fake someone else's biometrics than it is for you to change your own biometrics if someone does copy yours. This potentially makes biometrics a bad trade-off for the user. At the time of writing, this threat is highly speculative, but we believe it is worth raising and considering the potential consequences.	Cryptography and Security	22/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.17871v1	B-Privacy: Defining and Enforcing Privacy in Weighted Voting	Samuel Breckenridge; Dani Vilardell; Andrés Fábrega; Amy Zhao; Patrick McCorry; Rafael Solari; Ari Juels	"In traditional, one-vote-per-person voting systems, privacy equates with ballot secrecy: voting tallies are published, but individual voters' choices are concealed.   Voting systems that weight votes in proportion to token holdings, though, are now prevalent in cryptocurrency and web3 systems. We show that these weighted-voting systems overturn existing notions of voter privacy. Our experiments demonstrate that even with secret ballots, publishing raw tallies often reveals voters' choices.   Weighted voting thus requires a new framework for privacy. We introduce a notion called B-privacy whose basis is bribery, a key problem in voting systems today. B-privacy captures the economic cost to an adversary of bribing voters based on revealed voting tallies.   We propose a mechanism to boost B-privacy by noising voting tallies. We prove bounds on its tradeoff between B-privacy and transparency, meaning reported-tally accuracy. Analyzing 3,582 proposals across 30 Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), we find that the prevalence of large voters (""whales"") limits the effectiveness of any B-Privacy-enhancing technique. However, our mechanism proves to be effective in cases without extreme voting weight concentration: among proposals requiring coalitions of $\geq5$ voters to flip outcomes, our mechanism raises B-privacy by a geometric mean factor of $4.1\times$.   Our work offers the first principled guidance on transparency-privacy tradeoffs in weighted-voting systems, complementing existing approaches that focus on ballot secrecy and revealing fundamental constraints that voting weight concentration imposes on privacy mechanisms."

10.48550/arXiv.2509.17836v1	Federated Learning in the Wild: A Comparative Study for Cybersecurity   under Non-IID and Unbalanced Settings	Roberto Doriguzzi-Corin; Petr Sabel; Silvio Cretti; Silvio Ranise	Machine Learning (ML) techniques have shown strong potential for network traffic analysis; however, their effectiveness depends on access to representative, up-to-date datasets, which is limited in cybersecurity due to privacy and data-sharing restrictions. To address this challenge, Federated Learning (FL) has recently emerged as a novel paradigm that enables collaborative training of ML models across multiple clients while ensuring that sensitive data remains local. Nevertheless, Federated Averaging (FedAvg), the canonical FL algorithm, has proven poor convergence in heterogeneous environments where data distributions are non-independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and client datasets are unbalanced, conditions frequently observed in cybersecurity contexts. To overcome these challenges, several alternative FL strategies have been developed, yet their applicability to network intrusion detection remains insufficiently explored. This study systematically reviews and evaluates a range of FL methods in the context of intrusion detection for DDoS attacks. Using a dataset of network attacks within a Kubernetes-based testbed, we assess convergence efficiency, computational overhead, bandwidth consumption, and model accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comparative analysis of FL algorithms for intrusion detection under realistic non-i.i.d. and unbalanced settings, providing new insights for the design of robust, privacypreserving network security solutions.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.17832v1	AEAS: Actionable Exploit Assessment System	Xiangmin Shen; Wenyuan Cheng; Yan Chen; Zhenyuan Li; Yuqiao Gu; Lingzhi Wang; Wencheng Zhao; Dawei Sun; Jiashui Wang	Security practitioners face growing challenges in exploit assessment, as public vulnerability repositories are increasingly populated with inconsistent and low-quality exploit artifacts. Existing scoring systems, such as CVSS and EPSS, offer limited support for this task. They either rely on theoretical metrics or produce opaque probability estimates without assessing whether usable exploit code exists. In practice, security teams often resort to manual triage of exploit repositories, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale. We present AEAS, an automated system designed to assess and prioritize actionable exploits through static analysis. AEAS analyzes both exploit code and associated documentation to extract a structured set of features reflecting exploit availability, functionality, and setup complexity. It then computes an actionability score for each exploit and produces ranked exploit recommendations. We evaluate AEAS on a dataset of over 5,000 vulnerabilities derived from 600+ real-world applications frequently encountered by red teams. Manual validation and expert review on representative subsets show that AEAS achieves a 100% top-3 success rate in recommending functional exploits and shows strong alignment with expert-validated rankings. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of AEAS in supporting exploit-driven vulnerability prioritization.	Cryptography and Security	22/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.17778v1	Quickest Change Detection in Continuous-Time in Presence of a Covert   Adversary	Amir Reza Ramtin; Philippe Nain; Don Towsley	We investigate the problem of covert quickest change detection in a continuous-time setting, where a Brownian motion experiences a drift change at an unknown time. Unlike classical formulations, we consider a covert adversary who adjusts the post-change drift $\mu = \mu(\gamma)$ as a function of the false alarm constraint parameter $\gamma$, with the goal of remaining undetected for as long as possible. Leveraging the exact expressions for the average detection delay (ADD) and average time to false alarm (AT2FA) known for the continuous-time CuSum procedure, we rigorously analyze how the asymptotic behavior of ADD evolves as $\mu(\gamma) \to 0$ with increasing $\gamma$. Our results reveal that classical detection delay characterizations no longer hold in this regime. We derive sharp asymptotic expressions for the ADD under various convergence rates of $\mu(\gamma)$, identify precise conditions for maintaining covertness, and characterize the total damage inflicted by the adversary. We show that the adversary achieves maximal damage when the drift scales as $\mu(\gamma) = \Theta(1/\sqrt{\gamma})$, marking a fundamental trade-off between stealth and impact in continuous-time detection systems.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.17722v1	Public Key Encryption with Equality Test from Tag-Based Encryption	Masayuki Tezuka; Keisuke Tanaka	Public key encryption with equality test (PKEET), proposed by Yang et al. (CT-RSA 2010), is a variant of public key encryption that enables an equality test to determine whether two ciphertexts correspond to the same plaintext. This test applies not only for ciphertexts generated under the same encryption key but also for those generated under different encryption keys. To date, several generic constructions of PKEET have been proposed. However, these generic constructions have the drawback of reliance on the random oracle model or a (hierarchical) identity-based encryption scheme. In this paper, we propose a generic construction of a PKEET scheme based on tag-based encryption without the random oracle model. Tag-based encryption is a weaker primitive than identity-based encryption. Our scheme allows to derive new PKEET schemes without the random oracle model. By instantiating our construction with the pairing-free tag-based encryption scheme by Kiltz (TCC 2006), we obtain a pairing-free PKEET scheme without the random oracle model. Moreover, by instantiating our construction with a tag-based encryption scheme based on the learning parity with noise (LPN) assumption, we obtain a PKEET scheme based on the LPN assumption without the random oracle model.

In this work, we propose an ordered multi-signature scheme by modifying the sequential aggregate signature scheme by Chatterjee and Kabaleeshwaran (ACISP 2020). Our scheme offers compact public parameter size and the public-key aggregation property. This property allows us to compress a public-key list into a short aggregated key. We prove the security of our scheme under the symmetric external Diffie-Hellman (SXDH) assumption without the random oracle model.	Cryptography and Security	22/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.17595v2	Impossibility Results of Card-Based Protocols via Mathematical   Optimization	Shunnosuke Ikeda; Kazumasa Shinagawa	This paper introduces mathematical optimization as a new method for proving impossibility results in the field of card-based cryptography. While previous impossibility proofs were often limited to cases involving a small number of cards, this new approach establishes results that hold for a large number of cards. The research focuses on single-cut full-open (SCFO) protocols, which consist of performing one random cut and then revealing all cards. The main contribution is that for any three-variable Boolean function, no new SCFO protocols exist beyond those already known, under the condition that all additional cards have the same color. The significance of this work is that it provides a new framework for proving impossibility results and delivers a proof that is valid for any number of cards, as long as all additional cards have the same color.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.17581v1	PRNU-Bench: A Novel Benchmark and Model for PRNU-Based Camera   Identification	Florinel Alin Croitoru; Vlad Hondru; Radu Tudor Ionescu	We propose a novel benchmark for camera identification via Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) estimation. The benchmark comprises 13K photos taken with 120+ cameras, where the training and test photos are taken in different scenarios, enabling ``in-the-wild'' evaluation. In addition, we propose a novel PRNU-based camera identification model that employs a hybrid architecture, comprising a denoising autoencoder to estimate the PRNU signal and a convolutional network that can perform 1:N verification of camera devices. Instead of using a conventional approach based on contrastive learning, our method takes the Hadamard product between reference and query PRNU signals as input. This novel design leads to significantly better results compared with state-of-the-art models based on denoising autoencoders and contrastive learning. We release our dataset and code at: https://github.com/CroitoruAlin/PRNU-Bench.	Cryptography and Security	22/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.17508v1	Community Covert Communication - Dynamic Mass Covert Communication   Through Social Media	Eric Filiol	Since the early 2010s, social network-based influence technologies have grown almost exponentially. Initiated by the U.S. Army's early OEV system in 2011, a number of companies specializing in this field have emerged. The most (in)famous cases are Bell Pottinger, Cambridge Analytica, Aggregate-IQ and, more recently, Team Jorge.   In this paper, we consider the use-case of sock puppet master activities, which consist in creating hundreds or even thousands of avatars, in organizing them into communities and implement influence operations. On-purpose software is used to automate these operations (e.g. Ripon software, AIMS) and organize these avatar populations into communities. The aim is to organize targeted and directed influence communication to rather large communities (influence targets).   The goal of the present research work is to show how these community management techniques (social networks) can also be used to communicate/disseminate relatively large volumes (up to a few tens of Mb) of multi-level encrypted information to a limited number of actors. To a certain extent, this can be compared to a Dark Post-type function, with a number of much more powerful potentialities. As a consequence, the concept of communication has been totally redefined and disrupted, so that eavesdropping, interception and jamming operations no longer make sense.

While recent work reveals significant gaps between LLMs' privacy Q&A performance and their agent behavior, existing benchmarks remain limited to static, simplified scenarios. We present PrivacyChecker, a model-agnostic, contextual integrity based mitigation approach that effectively reduces privacy leakage from 36.08% to 7.30% on DeepSeek-R1 and from 33.06% to 8.32% on GPT-4o, all while preserving task helpfulness. We also introduce PrivacyLens-Live, transforming static benchmarks into dynamic MCP and A2A environments that reveal substantially higher privacy risks in practical. Our modular mitigation approach integrates seamlessly into agent protocols through three deployment strategies, providing practical privacy protection for the emerging agentic ecosystem. Our data and code will be made available at https://aka.ms/privacy_in_action.	Cryptography and Security	22/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.17416v1	DINVMark: A Deep Invertible Network for Video Watermarking	Jianbin Ji; Dawen Xu; Li Dong; Lin Yang; Songhan He	With the wide spread of video, video watermarking has become increasingly crucial for copyright protection and content authentication. However, video watermarking still faces numerous challenges. For example, existing methods typically have shortcomings in terms of watermarking capacity and robustness, and there is a lack of specialized noise layer for High Efficiency Video Coding(HEVC) compression. To address these issues, this paper introduces a Deep Invertible Network for Video watermarking (DINVMark) and designs a noise layer to simulate HEVC compression. This approach not only in creases watermarking capacity but also enhances robustness. DINVMark employs an Invertible Neural Network (INN), where the encoder and decoder share the same network structure for both watermark embedding and extraction. This shared architecture ensures close coupling between the encoder and decoder, thereby improving the accuracy of the watermark extraction process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly enhances watermark robustness, preserves video quality, and substantially increases watermark embedding capacity.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.17409v1	A Lightweight Authentication and Key Agreement Protocol Design for FANET	Yao Wu; Ziye Jia; Qihui Wu; Yian Zhu	The advancement of low-altitude intelligent networks enables unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) interconnection via flying ad-hoc networks (FANETs), offering flexibility and decentralized coordination. However, resource constraints, dynamic topologies, and UAV operations in open environments present significant security and communication challenges. Existing multi-factor and public-key cryptography protocols are vulnerable due to their reliance on stored sensitive information, increasing the risk of exposure and compromise. This paper proposes a lightweight authentication and key agreement protocol for FANETs, integrating physical unclonable functions with dynamic credential management and lightweight cryptographic primitives. The protocol reduces computational and communication overhead while enhancing security. Security analysis confirms its resilience against various attacks, and comparative evaluations demonstrate its superiority in security, communication efficiency, and computational cost.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.17371v2	SilentStriker:Toward Stealthy Bit-Flip Attacks on Large Language Models	Haotian Xu; Qingsong Peng; Jie Shi; Huadi Zheng; Yu Li; Cheng Zhuo	The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in critical domains has spurred extensive research into their security issues. While input manipulation attacks (e.g., prompt injection) have been well studied, Bit-Flip Attacks (BFAs) -- which exploit hardware vulnerabilities to corrupt model parameters and cause severe performance degradation -- have received far less attention. Existing BFA methods suffer from key limitations: they fail to balance performance degradation and output naturalness, making them prone to discovery. In this paper, we introduce SilentStriker, the first stealthy bit-flip attack against LLMs that effectively degrades task performance while maintaining output naturalness. Our core contribution lies in addressing the challenge of designing effective loss functions for LLMs with variable output length and the vast output space. Unlike prior approaches that rely on output perplexity for attack loss formulation, which inevitably degrade output naturalness, we reformulate the attack objective by leveraging key output tokens as targets for suppression, enabling effective joint optimization of attack effectiveness and stealthiness. Additionally, we employ an iterative, progressive search strategy to maximize attack efficacy. Experiments show that SilentStriker significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving successful attacks without compromising the naturalness of generated text.

We propose TextCrafter, an optimization-based adversarial perturbation mechanism that combines RL learned, geometry aware noise injection orthogonal to user embeddings with cluster priors and PII signal guidance to suppress inversion while preserving task utility. Unlike prior defenses either non learnable or agnostic to perturbation direction, TextCrafter provides a directional protective policy that balances privacy and utility. Under strong privacy setting, TextCrafter maintains 70 percentage classification accuracy on four datasets and consistently outperforms Gaussian/LDP baselines across lower privacy budgets, demonstrating a superior privacy utility trade off.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.17266v1	Privacy-Preserving State Estimation with Crowd Sensors: An   Information-Theoretic Respective	Farhad Farokhi	Privacy-preserving state estimation for linear time-invariant dynamical systems with crowd sensors is considered. At any time step, the estimator has access to measurements from a randomly selected sensor from a pool of sensors with pre-specified models and noise profiles. A Luenberger-like observer is used to fuse the measurements with the underlying model of the system to recursively generate the state estimates. An additive privacy-preserving noise is used to constrain information leakage. Information leakage is measured via mutual information between the identity of the sensors and the state estimate conditioned on the actual state of the system. This captures an omnipotent adversary that not only can access state estimates but can also gather direct high-quality state measurements. Any prescribed level of information leakage is shown to be achievable by appropriately selecting the variance of the privacy-preserving noise. Therefore, privacy-utility trade-off can be fine-tuned.

10.48550/arXiv.2509.17263v1	Bridging Cybersecurity Practice and Law: a Hands-on, Scenario-Based   Curriculum Using the NICE Framework to Foster Skill Development	Colman McGuan; Aadithyan V. Raghavan; Komala M. Mandapati; Chansu Yu; Brian E. Ray; Debbie K. Jackson; Sathish Kumar	In an increasingly interconnected world, cybersecurity professionals play a pivotal role in safeguarding organizations from cyber threats. To secure their cyberspace, organizations are forced to adopt a cybersecurity framework such as the NIST National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework). Although these frameworks are a good starting point for businesses and offer critical information to identify, prevent, and respond to cyber incidents, they can be difficult to navigate and implement, particularly for small-medium businesses (SMB). To help overcome this issue, this paper identifies the most frequent attack vectors to SMBs (Objective 1) and proposes a practical model of both technical and non-technical tasks, knowledge, skills, abilities (TKSA) from the NICE Framework for those attacks (Objective 2). The research develops a scenario-based curriculum. By immersing learners in realistic cyber threat scenarios, their practical understanding and preparedness in responding to cybersecurity incidents is enhanced (Objective 3). Finally, this work integrates practical experience and real-life skill development into the curriculum (Objective 4). SMBs can use the model as a guide to evaluate, equip their existing workforce, or assist in hiring new employees. In addition, educational institutions can use the model to develop scenario-based learning modules to adequately equip the emerging cybersecurity workforce for SMBs. Trainees will have the opportunity to practice both technical and legal issues in a simulated environment, thereby strengthening their ability to identify, mitigate, and respond to cyber threats effectively.

We show a novel class of low-cost, passive LiDAR spoofing attacks that exploit mirror-like surfaces to inject or remove objects from an AV's perception. Using planar mirrors to redirect LiDAR beams, these attacks require no electronics or custom fabrication and can be deployed in real settings. We define two adversarial goals: Object Addition Attacks (OAA), which create phantom obstacles, and Object Removal Attacks (ORA), which conceal real hazards. We develop geometric optics models, validate them with controlled outdoor experiments using a commercial LiDAR and an Autoware-equipped vehicle, and implement a CARLA-based simulation for scalable testing. Experiments show mirror attacks corrupt occupancy grids, induce false detections, and trigger unsafe planning and control behaviors. We discuss potential defenses (thermal sensing, multi-sensor fusion, light-fingerprinting) and their limitations.	Cryptography and Security	21/09/2025

Trustless   Consensus Manipulation Through Bribing Contracts	Bence Soóki-Tóth; István András Seres; Kamilla Kara; Ábel Nagy; Balázs Pejó; Gergely Biczók	The long-term success of cryptocurrencies largely depends on the incentive compatibility provided to the validators. Bribery attacks, facilitated trustlessly via smart contracts, threaten this foundation. This work introduces, implements, and evaluates three novel and efficient bribery contracts targeting Ethereum validators. The first bribery contract enables a briber to fork the blockchain by buying votes on their proposed blocks. The second contract incentivizes validators to voluntarily exit the consensus protocol, thus increasing the adversary's relative staking power. The third contract builds a trustless bribery market that enables the briber to auction off their manipulative power over the RANDAO, Ethereum's distributed randomness beacon. Finally, we provide an initial game-theoretical analysis of one of the described bribery markets.	Cryptography and Security	21/09/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2509.17126v1	Unaligned Incentives: Pricing Attacks Against Blockchain Rollups	Stefanos Chaliasos; Conner Swann; Sina Pilehchiha; Nicolas Mohnblatt; Benjamin Livshits; Assimakis Kattis	Rollups have become the de facto scalability solution for Ethereum, securing more than $55B in assets. They achieve scale by executing transactions on a Layer 2 ledger, while periodically posting data and finalizing state on the Layer 1, either optimistically or via validity proofs. Their fees must simultaneously reflect the pricing of three resources: L2 costs (e.g., execution), L1 DA, and underlying L1 gas costs for batch settlement and proof verification. In this work, we identify critical mis-pricings in existing rollup transaction fee mechanisms (TFMs) that allow for two powerful attacks. Firstly, an adversary can saturate the L2's DA batch capacity with compute-light data-heavy transactions, forcing low-gas transaction batches that enable both L2 DoS attacks, and finality-delay attacks. Secondly, by crafting prover killer transactions that maximize proving cycles relative to the gas charges, an adversary can effectively stall proof generation, delaying finality by hours and inflicting prover-side economic losses to the rollup at a minimal cost.   We analyze the above attack vectors across the major Ethereum rollups, quantifying adversarial costs and protocol losses. We find that the first attack enables periodic DoS on rollups, lasting up to 30 minutes, at a cost below 2 ETH for most rollups. Moreover, we identify three rollups that are exposed to indefinite DoS at a cost of approximately 0.8 to 2.7 ETH per hour. The attack can be further modified to increase finalization delays by a factor of about 1.45x to 2.73x, compared to direct L1 blob-stuffing, depending on the rollup's parameters. Furthermore, we find that the prover killer attack induces a finalization latency increase of about 94x. Finally, we propose comprehensive mitigations to prevent these attacks and suggest how some practical uses of multi-dimensional rollup TFMs can rectify the identified mis-pricing attacks.
