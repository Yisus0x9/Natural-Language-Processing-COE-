10.1111/ppe.12615	Acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: A causal association or bias?	Masarwa R; Platt RW; Filion KB	BACKGROUND: The association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the development of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the offspring may be due to bias. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to assess the role of potential unmeasured confounding in the estimation of the association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of ADHD, through bias analysis. The secondary objective was to assess the roles of selection bias and exposure misclassification. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library up to December 2018. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: We included observational studies examining the association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of ADHD. SYNTHESIS: We meta-analysed data across studies, using random-effects model. We conducted a bias analysis to studies that did not adjust for important confounders, to explore systematic errors related to unmeasured confounding, selection bias, and exposure misclassification. RESULTS: The search resulted in seven studies included in our meta-analysis. When adjusted estimates were pooled across all studies, the risk ratio (RR) for ADHD was 1.35 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25, 1.46; I(2) = 48%). Sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding in this meta-analysis showed that a confounder of 1.69 on the RR scale would reduce to 10% the proportion of studies with a true effect size of RR &gt;1.10. Unmeasured confounding bias analysis decreased the point estimate in five of the seven studies and increased in two studies, suggesting that the observed association could be confounded by parental ADHD. Unadjusted and bias-corrected risk ratios (bcRRs) were: RR = 1.34, bcRR = 1.13; RR = 1.51, bcRR = 1.17; RR = 1.63, bcRR = 1.38; RR = 1.44, bcRR = 1.17; RR = 1.16, bcRR = 1.18; RR = 1.25, bcRR = 1.05; and RR = 0.99, bcRR = 1.18. CONCLUSIONS: Bias analysis suggests that the previously reported association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and an increased risk of ADHD in the offspring may be due to unmeasured confounding. Our ability to conclude a causal association is limited.	Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol	01/05/2020	
10.1016/S1474-4422(25)00270-4	Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: 2024 revisions of the McDonald criteria.

The new 2024 McDonald criteria provide a unified approach for diagnosing multiple sclerosis in individuals with relapsing or progressive courses throughout the lifespan (ie, from paediatric to late-life presentations). The optic nerve can now serve as a fifth anatomical location within the CNS for diagnosis. The central vein sign, paramagnetic rim lesions, and kappa free-light chain concentrations in CSF can be used, when available, to provide supportive evidence and confer specificity for a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in specific situations. In certain cases, radiologically isolated syndrome or neurological symptoms that do not constitute a clear attack or progression of disability can fulfil the criteria for a multiple sclerosis diagnosis. We also provide guidance for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in older individuals (≥50 years) and those with comorbidities. The 2024 revised criteria should expedite the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, while maintaining specificity.	Lancet Neurol	01/10/2025	
10.1007/s00421-010-1658-5	Association among basal serum BDNF, cardiorespiratory fitness and cardiovascular disease risk factors in untrained healthy Korean men.	Jung SH; Kim J; Davis JM; Blair SN; Cho HC	Evidence suggests that serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (serum BDNF) can be affected by cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), but this relationship is far from clear. Recent reports show an inverse relationship between serum BDNF and CRF in healthy individuals, and other studies suggest a possible association between serum BDNF and cardiovascular disease. However, the possible interaction between serum BDNF, CRF, and cardiovascular disease risk has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to examine the association among serum BDNF, CRF, and cardiovascular disease risk factors in healthy men. The investigation involved a large sample of men (n = 995, age range: 20-76 years) who live in the central area of South Korea and were recruited into the Preventive Health Study. Our study showed a significant inverse relationship between serum BDNF and relative VO(2)max (r = -0.412, p &lt; 0.0001) and heart rate reserve (r = -0.194, p &lt; 0.0001). Serum BDNF was positively correlated with body mass index (r = 0.80, p &lt; 0.0001), total cholesterol (r = 0.185, p &lt; 0.0001), and triglyceride (r = 0.320, p &lt; 0.0001). Our data suggest that serum BDNF may be associated with effects of increased CRF on cardiovascular disease. However, more research is clearly needed before a determination of whether, and to what extent, serum BDNF may be responsible for some of the health benefits associated with CRF.

10.3390/ijms21030969	Precision Psychiatry Applications with Pharmacogenomics: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Approaches.	Lin E; Lin CH; Lane HY	A growing body of evidence now suggests that precision psychiatry, an interdisciplinary field of psychiatry, precision medicine, and pharmacogenomics, serves as an indispensable foundation of medical practices by offering the accurate medication with the accurate dose at the accurate time to patients with psychiatric disorders. In light of the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, numerous biomarkers and genetic loci associated with psychiatric diseases and relevant treatments are being discovered in precision psychiatry research by employing neuroimaging and multi-omics. In this review, we focus on the latest developments for precision psychiatry research using artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches, such as deep learning and neural network algorithms, together with multi-omics and neuroimaging data. Firstly, we review precision psychiatry and pharmacogenomics studies that leverage various artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to assess treatment prediction, prognosis prediction, diagnosis prediction, and the detection of potential biomarkers. In addition, we describe potential biomarkers and genetic loci that have been discovered to be associated with psychiatric diseases and relevant treatments. Moreover, we outline the limitations in regard to the previous precision psychiatry and pharmacogenomics studies. Finally, we present a discussion of directions and challenges for future research.

10.1177/1060028015606469	Association Between Prenatal Acetaminophen Exposure and Future Risk of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Children.	Hoover RM; Hayes VA; Erramouspe J	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of prenatal acetaminophen exposure on the future development of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. DATA SOURCES: Literature searches of MEDLINE (1975 to June 2015), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1975 to June 2015), and Cochrane Database (publications through June 2015) for prospective clinical trials assessing the relationship of prenatal acetaminophen exposure and the development of attention deficit disorders or hyperactivity. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies comparing self-reported maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy to development of ADHD or ADHD-like behaviors in offspring between the ages of 3 and 12 years. DATA SYNTHESIS: Four studies examining the effects of prenatal acetaminophen exposure on subsequent ADHD behaviors were identified. Of these, one early study found no link to ADHD behaviors while the other studies found statistically significant correlations with the most prominent being a study finding a higher risk for using ADHD medications (hazard ratio = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.15-1.44) or having ADHD-like behaviors at age 7 years as determined by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (risk ratio = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.27) in children whose mothers used acetaminophen during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: While there does appear to be a mild correlation between prenatal acetaminophen use and the development of ADHD symptoms in children, current data do not provide sufficient evidence that prenatal acetaminophen exposure leads to development of ADHD symptoms late in life. Acetaminophen is a preferred option for pain management during pregnancy when compared with other medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opioids for pyretic or pain relief.

10.4088/JCP.18m12612	Prenatal Exposure to Acetaminophen and the Risk of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A Nationwide Study in Taiwan.	Chen MH; Pan TL; Wang PW; Hsu JW; Huang KL; Su TP; Li CT; Lin WC; Tsai SJ; Chen TJ; Bai YM	BACKGROUND: Studies have suggested that a significant association exists between prenatal exposure to acetaminophen and the offspring&#x27;s attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) risk. However, this association has largely been unexplored among the Asian population, generally, and the Taiwanese population, specifically. METHODS: In our study, 950 study pairs (children with ADHD [ICD-9-CM code: 314] and their mothers) and 3,800 control pairs (children without ADHD and their mothers) matched by demographic characteristics were identified between 1998 and 2008 from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database. Maternal use of acetaminophen was assessed in the first trimester, second trimester, and third trimester of pregnancy and over the period from 3 months before pregnancy to the date of last menstrual cycle. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis with adjustments for demographic data, gestational infections, comorbid perinatal conditions, and maternal mental health disorders indicated that exposure to acetaminophen in the second trimester (odds ratio [OR] = 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00-1.40), both the first and second trimesters (OR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.00-1.64), or in any trimester (OR = 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.42) was associated with an increased risk of ADHD in offspring. Sensitivity analysis excluding gestational infections and maternal mental health disorders confirmed this association (OR = 1.33; 95% CI, 1.04-1.69). CONCLUSION: Prenatal exposure to acetaminophen was associated with an increased risk of ADHD in offspring, regardless of gestational infections and maternal mental health disorders. Additional studies are necessary to clarify the underlying mechanisms by which prenatal exposure to acetaminophen leads to neurodevelopmental risks.	J Clin Psychiatry	10/09/2019	
10.1038/s41392-025-02390-w	Spatiotemporal multi-omics analysis uncovers NAD-dependent immunosuppressive niche triggering early gastric cancer.	Gao P; Zuo C; Yuan W; Cai J; Chai X; Gong R; Yu J; Yao L; Su W; Liu Z; Lin S; Wang Y; Cai M; Ma L; Li Q; Zhou P	Understanding the cellular origins and early evolutionary dynamics that drive the initiation of carcinogenesis is critical to advancing early detection and prevention strategies. By characterizing key molecular, cellular and niche events at the precancerous tipping point of early gastric cancer (EGC), we aimed to develop more precise screening tools and design targeted interventions to prevent malignant transformation at this stage. We utilized our AI models to integrate spatial multimodal data from nine EGC endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) samples (covering sequential stages from normal to cancer), construct a spatial-temporal profile of disease progression, and identify a critical tipping point (PMC_P) characterized by an immune-suppressive microenvironment during early cancer development. At this stage, inflammatory pit mucous cells with stemness (PMC_2) interact with fibroblasts via NAMPT  ⟶  ITGA5/ITGB1 and with macrophages via AREG  ⟶  EGFR/ERBB2 signaling, fostering cancer initiation. We established gastric precancerous cell lines and organoids to demonstrate that NAMPT and AREG promote cellular proliferation in vitro. Furthermore, in the transgenic CEA-SV40 mouse model, targeting AREG and/or NAMPT disrupted key cell interactions, inhibited the JAK-STAT, MAPK, and NFκB pathways, and reduced PD-L1 expression, which was also confirmed by western blot in vitro. These interventions delayed disease progression, reversed the immunosuppressive microenvironment, and prevented malignant transformation. Clinical validation was conducted using endoscopically resected EGC specimens. Our study provides a precise spatiotemporal depiction of EGC development and identifies novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for early intervention.

10.1038/s42255-025-01371-1	Mapping the plasma metabolome to human health and disease in 274,241 adults.	You J; Cui XH; Chen YL; Wang YX; Li HY; Qiang YX; Cheng JY; Deng YT; Guo Y; Ren P; Zhang Y; He Y; He XY; Chen SD; Zhang YR; Huang YY; Mao Y; Feng JF; Cheng W; Yu JT	A systematic characterization of metabolic profiles in human health and disease enhances precision medicine. Here we present a comprehensive human metabolome-phenome atlas, using data from 274,241 UK Biobank participants with nuclear magnetic resonance metabolic measures. This atlas links 313 plasma metabolites to 1,386 diseases and 3,142 traits, with participants being prospectively followed for a median of 14.9 years. This atlas uncovered 52,836 metabolite-disease and 73,639 metabolite-trait associations, where the ratio of cholesterol to total lipids in large low-density lipoprotein percentage was found as the metabolite associated with the highest number (n = 526) of diseases. In addition, we found that more than half (57.5%) of metabolites showed statistical variations from healthy individuals over a decade before disease onset. Combined with demographics, the machine-learning-based metabolic risk score signified the top 30 (around 10%) metabolites as biomarkers, yielding favourable classification performance (area under the curve &gt; 0.8) for 94 prevalent and 81 incident diseases. Finally, Mendelian randomization analyses provided support for causal relationships of 454 metabolite-disease pairs, among which 402 exhibited shared genetic determinants. Additional insights can be gleaned via an accessible interactive resource ( https://metabolome-phenome-atlas.com/ ).	Nat Metab	19/09/2025	
10.1146/annurev-virology-092818-015907	Cancers in Humans: A Lifelong Search for Contributions of Infectious Agents, Autobiographic Notes.	Zur Hausen H	This review briefly covers periods of my early life; experiences during World War II; my school education; and my period as a medical student in Bonn, Hamburg, and Düsseldorf. Mainly emphasized is my scientific career after finishing my medical internship and periods as a postdoc at the Institute for Microbiology in Düsseldorf and the Virus Laboratories of the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia and as Senior Research Fellow at the Institute of Virology in Würzburg, Germany. Subsequent appointment as chairman of the newly established Institute of Virology, University of Erlangen-Nürnberg, in a similar position at the University of Freiburg, and then for 20 years as scientific director of the Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, are discussed, covering the scientific developments during these periods. The emeritus period since 2003 was particularly exciting, leading to the discovery of autonomously replicating plasmids, derived from specific bacteria, and their link to common human cancers (colon, breast, and prostate).

We provide updated global estimates of prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs) from 1990 to 2021 across 204 countries and territories and forecasts through 2050. In 2021, there are 2.0 billion people with TTH and 1.2 billion with migraine. Although TTH is more prevalent, migraine causes higher disability. While crude prevalence and YLDs increased, age-standardized rates remained stable and are projected to continue this trend due to population growth. There is a disproportionately higher burden in women aged 30-44 and countries with higher Socio-demographic Index and Healthcare Access and Quality Index. Despite this, migraines remain underrecognized in health policies and funding. This study emphasizes the urgent need to prioritize headache disorders in global health agendas.
