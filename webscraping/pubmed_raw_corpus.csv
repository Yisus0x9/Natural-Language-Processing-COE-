10.1111/ppe.12615	Acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: A causal association or bias?	Masarwa R; Platt RW; Filion KB	BACKGROUND: The association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the development of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the offspring may be due to bias. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to assess the role of potential unmeasured confounding in the estimation of the association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of ADHD, through bias analysis. The secondary objective was to assess the roles of selection bias and exposure misclassification. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library up to December 2018. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: We included observational studies examining the association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of ADHD. SYNTHESIS: We meta-analysed data across studies, using random-effects model. We conducted a bias analysis to studies that did not adjust for important confounders, to explore systematic errors related to unmeasured confounding, selection bias, and exposure misclassification. RESULTS: The search resulted in seven studies included in our meta-analysis. When adjusted estimates were pooled across all studies, the risk ratio (RR) for ADHD was 1.35 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25, 1.46; I(2) = 48%). Sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding in this meta-analysis showed that a confounder of 1.69 on the RR scale would reduce to 10% the proportion of studies with a true effect size of RR &gt;1.10. Unmeasured confounding bias analysis decreased the point estimate in five of the seven studies and increased in two studies, suggesting that the observed association could be confounded by parental ADHD. Unadjusted and bias-corrected risk ratios (bcRRs) were: RR = 1.34, bcRR = 1.13; RR = 1.51, bcRR = 1.17; RR = 1.63, bcRR = 1.38; RR = 1.44, bcRR = 1.17; RR = 1.16, bcRR = 1.18; RR = 1.25, bcRR = 1.05; and RR = 0.99, bcRR = 1.18. CONCLUSIONS: Bias analysis suggests that the previously reported association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and an increased risk of ADHD in the offspring may be due to unmeasured confounding. Our ability to conclude a causal association is limited.	Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol	2020 May	
10.1016/S1474-4422(25)00270-4	Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: 2024 revisions of the McDonald criteria.

The new 2024 McDonald criteria provide a unified approach for diagnosing multiple sclerosis in individuals with relapsing or progressive courses throughout the lifespan (ie, from paediatric to late-life presentations). The optic nerve can now serve as a fifth anatomical location within the CNS for diagnosis. The central vein sign, paramagnetic rim lesions, and kappa free-light chain concentrations in CSF can be used, when available, to provide supportive evidence and confer specificity for a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in specific situations. In certain cases, radiologically isolated syndrome or neurological symptoms that do not constitute a clear attack or progression of disability can fulfil the criteria for a multiple sclerosis diagnosis. We also provide guidance for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in older individuals (≥50 years) and those with comorbidities. The 2024 revised criteria should expedite the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, while maintaining specificity.	Lancet Neurol	2025 Oct	
10.3390/ijms21030969	Precision Psychiatry Applications with Pharmacogenomics: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Approaches.	Lin E; Lin CH; Lane HY	A growing body of evidence now suggests that precision psychiatry, an interdisciplinary field of psychiatry, precision medicine, and pharmacogenomics, serves as an indispensable foundation of medical practices by offering the accurate medication with the accurate dose at the accurate time to patients with psychiatric disorders. In light of the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, numerous biomarkers and genetic loci associated with psychiatric diseases and relevant treatments are being discovered in precision psychiatry research by employing neuroimaging and multi-omics. In this review, we focus on the latest developments for precision psychiatry research using artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches, such as deep learning and neural network algorithms, together with multi-omics and neuroimaging data. Firstly, we review precision psychiatry and pharmacogenomics studies that leverage various artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to assess treatment prediction, prognosis prediction, diagnosis prediction, and the detection of potential biomarkers. In addition, we describe potential biomarkers and genetic loci that have been discovered to be associated with psychiatric diseases and relevant treatments. Moreover, we outline the limitations in regard to the previous precision psychiatry and pharmacogenomics studies. Finally, we present a discussion of directions and challenges for future research.

10.1007/s00421-010-1658-5	Association among basal serum BDNF, cardiorespiratory fitness and cardiovascular disease risk factors in untrained healthy Korean men.	Jung SH; Kim J; Davis JM; Blair SN; Cho HC	Evidence suggests that serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (serum BDNF) can be affected by cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), but this relationship is far from clear. Recent reports show an inverse relationship between serum BDNF and CRF in healthy individuals, and other studies suggest a possible association between serum BDNF and cardiovascular disease. However, the possible interaction between serum BDNF, CRF, and cardiovascular disease risk has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to examine the association among serum BDNF, CRF, and cardiovascular disease risk factors in healthy men. The investigation involved a large sample of men (n = 995, age range: 20-76 years) who live in the central area of South Korea and were recruited into the Preventive Health Study. Our study showed a significant inverse relationship between serum BDNF and relative VO(2)max (r = -0.412, p &lt; 0.0001) and heart rate reserve (r = -0.194, p &lt; 0.0001). Serum BDNF was positively correlated with body mass index (r = 0.80, p &lt; 0.0001), total cholesterol (r = 0.185, p &lt; 0.0001), and triglyceride (r = 0.320, p &lt; 0.0001). Our data suggest that serum BDNF may be associated with effects of increased CRF on cardiovascular disease. However, more research is clearly needed before a determination of whether, and to what extent, serum BDNF may be responsible for some of the health benefits associated with CRF.

10.4088/JCP.18m12612	Prenatal Exposure to Acetaminophen and the Risk of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A Nationwide Study in Taiwan.	Chen MH; Pan TL; Wang PW; Hsu JW; Huang KL; Su TP; Li CT; Lin WC; Tsai SJ; Chen TJ; Bai YM	BACKGROUND: Studies have suggested that a significant association exists between prenatal exposure to acetaminophen and the offspring&#x27;s attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) risk. However, this association has largely been unexplored among the Asian population, generally, and the Taiwanese population, specifically. METHODS: In our study, 950 study pairs (children with ADHD [ICD-9-CM code: 314] and their mothers) and 3,800 control pairs (children without ADHD and their mothers) matched by demographic characteristics were identified between 1998 and 2008 from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database. Maternal use of acetaminophen was assessed in the first trimester, second trimester, and third trimester of pregnancy and over the period from 3 months before pregnancy to the date of last menstrual cycle. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis with adjustments for demographic data, gestational infections, comorbid perinatal conditions, and maternal mental health disorders indicated that exposure to acetaminophen in the second trimester (odds ratio [OR] = 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00-1.40), both the first and second trimesters (OR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.00-1.64), or in any trimester (OR = 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.42) was associated with an increased risk of ADHD in offspring. Sensitivity analysis excluding gestational infections and maternal mental health disorders confirmed this association (OR = 1.33; 95% CI, 1.04-1.69). CONCLUSION: Prenatal exposure to acetaminophen was associated with an increased risk of ADHD in offspring, regardless of gestational infections and maternal mental health disorders. Additional studies are necessary to clarify the underlying mechanisms by which prenatal exposure to acetaminophen leads to neurodevelopmental risks.	J Clin Psychiatry	2019 Sep 10	
10.1038/s41392-025-02390-w	Spatiotemporal multi-omics analysis uncovers NAD-dependent immunosuppressive niche triggering early gastric cancer.	Gao P; Zuo C; Yuan W; Cai J; Chai X; Gong R; Yu J; Yao L; Su W; Liu Z; Lin S; Wang Y; Cai M; Ma L; Li Q; Zhou P	Understanding the cellular origins and early evolutionary dynamics that drive the initiation of carcinogenesis is critical to advancing early detection and prevention strategies. By characterizing key molecular, cellular and niche events at the precancerous tipping point of early gastric cancer (EGC), we aimed to develop more precise screening tools and design targeted interventions to prevent malignant transformation at this stage. We utilized our AI models to integrate spatial multimodal data from nine EGC endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) samples (covering sequential stages from normal to cancer), construct a spatial-temporal profile of disease progression, and identify a critical tipping point (PMC_P) characterized by an immune-suppressive microenvironment during early cancer development. At this stage, inflammatory pit mucous cells with stemness (PMC_2) interact with fibroblasts via NAMPT  ⟶  ITGA5/ITGB1 and with macrophages via AREG  ⟶  EGFR/ERBB2 signaling, fostering cancer initiation. We established gastric precancerous cell lines and organoids to demonstrate that NAMPT and AREG promote cellular proliferation in vitro. Furthermore, in the transgenic CEA-SV40 mouse model, targeting AREG and/or NAMPT disrupted key cell interactions, inhibited the JAK-STAT, MAPK, and NFκB pathways, and reduced PD-L1 expression, which was also confirmed by western blot in vitro. These interventions delayed disease progression, reversed the immunosuppressive microenvironment, and prevented malignant transformation. Clinical validation was conducted using endoscopically resected EGC specimens. Our study provides a precise spatiotemporal depiction of EGC development and identifies novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for early intervention.

10.1056/NEJMoa2504650	Low-Dose Aspirin for PI3K-Altered Localized Colorectal Cancer.	Martling A; Hed Myrberg I; Nilbert M; Grönberg H; Granath F; Eklund M; Öresland T; Iversen LH; Haapamäki C; Janson M; Westberg K; Segelman J; Ersson U; Prytz M; Angenete E; Bergström R; Mayrhofer M; Glimelius B; Lindberg J	BACKGROUND: Aspirin reduces the incidence of colorectal adenoma and colorectal cancer among high-risk persons. Observational studies suggest that aspirin may also improve disease-free survival after diagnosis, particularly among patients with tumors harboring somatic PIK3CA mutations. However, data from randomized trials are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with stage I, II, or III rectal cancer or stage II or III colon cancer with somatic alterations in PI3K pathway genes. The patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 160 mg of aspirin or matched placebo once daily for 3 years. Patients with prespecified PIK3CA hotspot mutations in exon 9 or 20 (group A alterations) and those with other moderate- or high-impact somatic variants in PIK3CA, PIK3R1, or PTEN (group B alterations) were eligible for randomization. The primary end point was colorectal cancer recurrence, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, in patients with group A alterations. Secondary end points included colorectal cancer recurrence in patients with group B alterations, disease-free survival, and safety. RESULTS: Alterations in PI3K pathway genes were detected in 1103 of 2980 patients (37.0%) with complete genomic data. Of 515 patients with group A alterations and 588 patients with group B alterations, 314 and 312, respectively, were assigned to receive aspirin or placebo. The estimated 3-year cumulative incidence of recurrence was 7.7% with aspirin and 14.1% with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24 to 0.98; P = 0.04) among patients with group A alterations and 7.7% and 16.8%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.83), among those with group B alterations. The estimated 3-year disease-free survival was 88.5% with aspirin and 81.4% with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.34 to 1.08) among patients with group A alterations and 89.1% and 78.7%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.88), among those with group B alterations. Severe adverse events occurred in 16.8% of aspirin recipients and 11.6% of placebo recipients. CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin led to a significantly lower incidence of colorectal cancer recurrence than placebo among patients with PIK3CA hotspot mutations in exon 9 or 20 and appeared to have a similar benefit among those with other somatic alterations in PI3K pathway genes.

10.1111/epi.17410	Drug resistance in idiopathic generalized epilepsies: Evidence and concepts.	Gesche J; Beier CP	Although approximately 10%-15% of patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE)/genetic generalized epilepsy remain drug-resistant, there is no consensus or established concept regarding the underlying mechanisms and prevalence. This review summarizes the recent data and the current hypotheses on mechanisms that may contribute to drug-resistant IGE. A literature search was conducted in PubMed and Embase for studies on mechanisms of drug resistance published since 1980. The literature shows neither consensus on the definition nor a widely accepted model to explain drug resistance in IGE or one of its subsyndromes. Large-scale genetic studies have failed to identify distinct genetic causes or affected genes involved in pharmacokinetics. We found clinical and experimental evidence in support of four hypotheses: (1) &quot;network hypothesis&quot;-the degree of drug resistance in IGE reflects the severity of cortical network alterations, (2) &quot;minor focal lesion in a predisposed brain hypothesis&quot;-minor cortical lesions are important for drug resistance, (3) &quot;interneuron hypothesis&quot;-impaired functioning of γ-aminobutyric acidergic interneurons contributes to drug resistance, and (4) &quot;changes in drug kinetics&quot;-genetically impaired kinetics of antiseizure medication (ASM) reduce the effectiveness of available ASMs. In summary, the exact definition and cause of drug resistance in IGE is unknown. However, published evidence suggests four different mechanisms that may warrant further investigation.	Epilepsia	2022 Dec
