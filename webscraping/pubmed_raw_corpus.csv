10.1111/ppe.12615	Acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: A causal association or bias?	Masarwa R; Platt RW; Filion KB	BACKGROUND: The association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the development of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the offspring may be due to bias. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to assess the role of potential unmeasured confounding in the estimation of the association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of ADHD, through bias analysis. The secondary objective was to assess the roles of selection bias and exposure misclassification. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library up to December 2018. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: We included observational studies examining the association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of ADHD. SYNTHESIS: We meta-analysed data across studies, using random-effects model. We conducted a bias analysis to studies that did not adjust for important confounders, to explore systematic errors related to unmeasured confounding, selection bias, and exposure misclassification. RESULTS: The search resulted in seven studies included in our meta-analysis. When adjusted estimates were pooled across all studies, the risk ratio (RR) for ADHD was 1.35 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25, 1.46; I(2) = 48%). Sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding in this meta-analysis showed that a confounder of 1.69 on the RR scale would reduce to 10% the proportion of studies with a true effect size of RR &gt;1.10. Unmeasured confounding bias analysis decreased the point estimate in five of the seven studies and increased in two studies, suggesting that the observed association could be confounded by parental ADHD. Unadjusted and bias-corrected risk ratios (bcRRs) were: RR = 1.34, bcRR = 1.13; RR = 1.51, bcRR = 1.17; RR = 1.63, bcRR = 1.38; RR = 1.44, bcRR = 1.17; RR = 1.16, bcRR = 1.18; RR = 1.25, bcRR = 1.05; and RR = 0.99, bcRR = 1.18. CONCLUSIONS: Bias analysis suggests that the previously reported association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and an increased risk of ADHD in the offspring may be due to unmeasured confounding. Our ability to conclude a causal association is limited.	Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol	01/05/2020
10.1038/s41586-025-09574-y	SPP1 is required for maintaining mesenchymal cell fate in pancreatic cancer.	Li H; Lan L; Chen H; Zaw Thin M; Ps H; Nelson JK; Evans IM; Ruiz EJ; Cheng R; Tran L; Allen M; Ma J; Yi T; Wang C; He Y; Guppy N; Sadanandam A; Lin SZ; Zhang C; Behrens A	Elucidating the complex network of communication between tumour cells is central to understanding cell fate decisions and progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)(1,2). We previously showed that constant suppression of BMP activity by the BMP antagonist GREM1 secreted by mesenchymal PDAC cells is essential for maintaining the fate of epithelial PDAC cells(3). Here we identify SPP1 (also known as osteopontin)(4) as a key regulator of mesenchymal cell fate in pancreatic cancer. Proteomic analysis of plasma from patients with PDAC showed that SPP1 is substantially upregulated in late-stage disease. Inactivation of Spp1 led to a delay in tumorigenesis in mouse PDAC models and abolished metastasis formation. Spp1 was expressed in epithelial PDAC cells, and Spp1 inactivation resulted in a conversion of mesenchymal to epithelial PDAC cells. Mechanistically, SPP1 bound the CD61 receptor on mesenchymal PDAC cells to induce Bmp2 and Grem1 expression, and GREM1 inhibition of BMP signalling was required for Spp1 expression in epithelial cells, thereby forming an intercellular regulatory loop. Concomitant inactivation of Grem1 reverted the epithelial phenotype of Spp1 knockout to fully mesenchymal PDAC. Conversely, Grem1 heterozygosity combined with Spp1 knockout resulted in wild-type PDAC histology, a result that confirmed the direct antagonistic functions of these factors. Hence, mesenchymal and epithelial PDAC cell fates are determined by the reciprocal paracrine regulation of the soluble factors GREM1 and SPP1.	Nature	24/09/2025
10.1038/s42255-025-01379-7	Cholesterol metabolic reprogramming mediates microglia-induced chronic neuroinflammation and hinders neurorestoration following stroke.	Zhao Q; Li J; Feng J; Wang X; Liu Y; Wang F; Liu L; Jin B; Lin M; Wang YC; Guo X; Chen J; Hao J	Chronic neuroinflammation is a major obstacle to post-stroke recovery, yet the underlying mechanisms, particularly the link between prolonged microglial activation and cholesterol metabolism, are not fully known. Here we show that ischaemic injury induces persistent microglial activation that perpetuates chronic inflammation, leading to microglial cholesterol accumulation and metabolic reprogramming. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified distinct stroke-associated foamy microglia clusters characterized by extensive reprogramming of cholesterol metabolism. Furthermore, direct intracerebral free cholesterol or cholesterol crystal infusion recapitulated sustained microglial activation, directly linking aberrant cholesterol metabolism to prolonged neuroinflammatory responses. Therapeutically, we demonstrate that reducing microglial cholesterol overload through genetic or pharmacological activation of CYP46A1 in male mice promotes white matter repair and functional recovery. These findings highlight microglial cholesterol metabolism as a key driver of post-stroke inflammation, offering therapeutic strategies targeting cholesterol metabolism to mitigate long-term brain damage and promote neurorestoration, potentially improving stroke-related disability outcomes.

10.1186/s12933-025-02921-3	Association of the triglyceride-glucose index combined with a body shape index with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in individuals with cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome stage 0-3: findings from two prospective cohorts.	Chen M; Guo J; Shangguan Y; Sun Z; He X; Tu Q; Yan Q	BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, as a measure of insulin resistance, has been confirmed to be associated with adverse clinical outcomes. The new composite indicator, TyG-A body type index (TyG-ABSI), by integrating the TyG index and the A body type index, has demonstrated superior efficacy in predicting the risk of cardiovascular death in the general population compared to traditional indicators. This study aims to deeply explore the association between TyG-ABSI and all-cause mortality and CVD mortality in the population with cardiovascular kidney-metabolic syndrome (CKM) stages 0-3. The analysis will be conducted from multiple dimensions such as the intensity of indicator correlation and potential influencing mechanisms, in order to comprehensively reveal the relationship between the two. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 13,480 participants in the NHANES cohort (1999-2018) using Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic spline functions. The results indicated that elevated TyG-ABSI values were independently associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 1.226, 95% CI 1.104-1.361) and cardiovascular mortality (HR = 1.377, 95% CI 1.149-1.651). Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and concordance index evaluations demonstrated that TyG-ABSI yielded more accurate long-term prognostic performance than other TyG-derived metrics. The area under the curve (AUC) of this indicator reached 0.688-0.708 in the prediction of all-cause mortality risk over 5-15 years, and 0.696-0.739 in the prediction of cardiovascular mortality risk. External validation using CHARLS data confirmed the robustness of these findings in predicting all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals with CKM stages 0-3, TyG-ABSI demonstrates a stronger association with mortality risk and superior predictive ability compared with other TyG-derived metrics. Its performance suggests a potential role in capturing variations across diverse clinical subgroups, and informing optimal timing for preventive interventions.	Cardiovasc Diabetol	23/09/2025
10.1016/S1474-4422(25)00270-4	Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: 2024 revisions of the McDonald criteria.	Montalban X; Lebrun-Frénay C; Oh J; Arrambide G; Moccia M; Pia Amato M; Amezcua L; Banwell B; Bar-Or A; Barkhof F; Butzkueven H; Ciccarelli O; Chataway J; Cohen JA; Comi G; Correale J; Deisenhammer F; Filippi M; Fiol J; Freedman MS; Fujihara K; Granziera C; Green AJ; Hartung HP; Hellwig K; Kappos L; Kimbrough D; Killestein J; Lublin F; Marignier R; Ann Marrie R; Miller A; Otero-Romero S; Ontaneda D; Ramanathan S; Reich D; Rocca MA; Rovira À; Saidha S; Salter A; Sastre-Garriga J; Saylor D; Solomon AJ; Sormani MP; Stankoff B; Tintore M; Tremlett H; Van der Walt A; Viswanathan S; Wiendl H; Wildemann B; Yamout B; Zaratin P; Calabresi PA; Coetzee T; Thompson AJ	Advances in the understanding of multiple sclerosis and the development of biomarkers of pathophysiology prompted a substantial revision of the 2017 McDonald diagnostic criteria. The new 2024 McDonald criteria provide a unified approach for diagnosing multiple sclerosis in individuals with relapsing or progressive courses throughout the lifespan (ie, from paediatric to late-life presentations). The optic nerve can now serve as a fifth anatomical location within the CNS for diagnosis. The central vein sign, paramagnetic rim lesions, and kappa free-light chain concentrations in CSF can be used, when available, to provide supportive evidence and confer specificity for a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in specific situations. In certain cases, radiologically isolated syndrome or neurological symptoms that do not constitute a clear attack or progression of disability can fulfil the criteria for a multiple sclerosis diagnosis. We also provide guidance for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in older individuals (≥50 years) and those with comorbidities. The 2024 revised criteria should expedite the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, while maintaining specificity.	Lancet Neurol	01/10/2025
10.3390/ijms21030969	Precision Psychiatry Applications with Pharmacogenomics: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Approaches.	Lin E; Lin CH; Lane HY	A growing body of evidence now suggests that precision psychiatry, an interdisciplinary field of psychiatry, precision medicine, and pharmacogenomics, serves as an indispensable foundation of medical practices by offering the accurate medication with the accurate dose at the accurate time to patients with psychiatric disorders. In light of the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, numerous biomarkers and genetic loci associated with psychiatric diseases and relevant treatments are being discovered in precision psychiatry research by employing neuroimaging and multi-omics. In this review, we focus on the latest developments for precision psychiatry research using artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches, such as deep learning and neural network algorithms, together with multi-omics and neuroimaging data. Firstly, we review precision psychiatry and pharmacogenomics studies that leverage various artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to assess treatment prediction, prognosis prediction, diagnosis prediction, and the detection of potential biomarkers. In addition, we describe potential biomarkers and genetic loci that have been discovered to be associated with psychiatric diseases and relevant treatments. Moreover, we outline the limitations in regard to the previous precision psychiatry and pharmacogenomics studies. Finally, we present a discussion of directions and challenges for future research.

10.1177/1060028015606469	Association Between Prenatal Acetaminophen Exposure and Future Risk of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Children.	Hoover RM; Hayes VA; Erramouspe J	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of prenatal acetaminophen exposure on the future development of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. DATA SOURCES: Literature searches of MEDLINE (1975 to June 2015), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1975 to June 2015), and Cochrane Database (publications through June 2015) for prospective clinical trials assessing the relationship of prenatal acetaminophen exposure and the development of attention deficit disorders or hyperactivity. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies comparing self-reported maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy to development of ADHD or ADHD-like behaviors in offspring between the ages of 3 and 12 years. DATA SYNTHESIS: Four studies examining the effects of prenatal acetaminophen exposure on subsequent ADHD behaviors were identified. Of these, one early study found no link to ADHD behaviors while the other studies found statistically significant correlations with the most prominent being a study finding a higher risk for using ADHD medications (hazard ratio = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.15-1.44) or having ADHD-like behaviors at age 7 years as determined by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (risk ratio = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.27) in children whose mothers used acetaminophen during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: While there does appear to be a mild correlation between prenatal acetaminophen use and the development of ADHD symptoms in children, current data do not provide sufficient evidence that prenatal acetaminophen exposure leads to development of ADHD symptoms late in life. Acetaminophen is a preferred option for pain management during pregnancy when compared with other medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opioids for pyretic or pain relief.

10.1007/s10549-022-06562-y	The feasibility of using an autologous GM-CSF-secreting breast cancer vaccine to induce immunity in patients with stage II-III and metastatic breast cancers.	Anderson KS; Erick TK; Chen M; Daley H; Campbell M; Colson Y; Mihm M; Zakka LR; Hopper M; Barry W; Winer EP; Dranoff G; Overmoyer B	PURPOSE: The antigenic targets of immunity and the role of vaccination in breast cancer are unknown. We performed a phase I study of an autologous GM-CSF-secreting breast cancer vaccine in patients with metastatic and stage II-III breast cancer. METHODS: Tumor cells from patients with metastatic (n = 15) and stage II-III (n = 7) disease were transduced with a replication-defective adenoviral vector encoding GM-CSF, and then irradiated. Twelve and seven patients with metastatic and stage II-III disease, respectively, received weekly vaccination for three weeks, followed by every other week until disease progression or vaccine supply was exhausted (metastatic) or until six total vaccine doses were administered (stage II-III). RESULTS: Among those patients with metastatic disease who received vaccinations, eight had progressive disease at two months, three had stable disease for 4-13 months, and one has had no evidence of disease for 13 years. Of the patients with stage II-III disease, five died of metastatic disease between 1.16 and 8.49 years after the start of vaccinations (median 6.24 years) and two are alive as of September 2021. Toxicities included injection site reactions, fatigue, fever, upper respiratory symptoms, joint pain, nausea, and edema. Four of five evaluable patients with metastatic disease developed a skin reaction with immune cell infiltration after the fifth injection of unmodified, irradiated tumor cells. CONCLUSION: We conclude that tumor cells can be harvested from patients with metastatic or stage II-III breast cancer to prepare autologous GM-CSF-secreting vaccines that induce coordinated immune responses with limited toxicity.

10.1016/j.cmet.2025.08.009	HEBP2-governed glutamine competition between tumor and macrophages dictates immunotherapy efficacy in triple-negative breast cancer.	Xiao Y （肖毅）; Xu Y （徐颖）; Wang H （王晗）; Yang F （杨帆）; Ding XH （丁晓洪）; Fu T （傅彤）; Chen L （陈力）; Jin X （金希）; Zhao YX （赵雅鑫）; Wang Y （王莹）; Chen F （陈芬芳）; Shao ZM （邵志敏）; Jiang YZ （江一舟）	Immunotherapy demonstrates limited efficacy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), influenced by intricate metabolic interactions within the tumor microenvironment. Here, we developed a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) immunotherapy cohort (N = 27) and a spatial transcriptomics cohort (N = 88) to elucidate metabolic crosstalk associated with therapeutic efficacy in TNBC. We illustrated that heme binding protein 2 (HEBP2)(high) tumor cells (featured by active glutathione metabolism) and CCL3(+) macrophages (characterized by oxidative metabolism) indicated immunotherapy efficacy and were quantitatively and spatially negatively correlated. HEBP2-mediated glutamine face-off between these cell types induced this phenomenon. Mechanistically, HEBP2 disrupted FOXA1 cytoplasmic phase separation, promoting its nuclear translocation to upregulate glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) expression and glutamine consumption in tumor cells. This metabolic shift induced ferroptosis of CCL3(+) macrophages, impairing the antitumor immunity. The utilization of a GSTP1 inhibitor sensitized TNBC to immunotherapy. Collectively, we delineate a tumor-macrophage metabolic checkpoint governed by the HEBP2/GSTP1 axis and pioneer single-cell-level immunometabolism as a paradigm for evaluating immunotherapeutic vulnerabilities.

10.1007/s00421-010-1658-5	Association among basal serum BDNF, cardiorespiratory fitness and cardiovascular disease risk factors in untrained healthy Korean men.	Jung SH; Kim J; Davis JM; Blair SN; Cho HC	Evidence suggests that serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (serum BDNF) can be affected by cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), but this relationship is far from clear. Recent reports show an inverse relationship between serum BDNF and CRF in healthy individuals, and other studies suggest a possible association between serum BDNF and cardiovascular disease. However, the possible interaction between serum BDNF, CRF, and cardiovascular disease risk has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to examine the association among serum BDNF, CRF, and cardiovascular disease risk factors in healthy men. The investigation involved a large sample of men (n = 995, age range: 20-76 years) who live in the central area of South Korea and were recruited into the Preventive Health Study. Our study showed a significant inverse relationship between serum BDNF and relative VO(2)max (r = -0.412, p &lt; 0.0001) and heart rate reserve (r = -0.194, p &lt; 0.0001). Serum BDNF was positively correlated with body mass index (r = 0.80, p &lt; 0.0001), total cholesterol (r = 0.185, p &lt; 0.0001), and triglyceride (r = 0.320, p &lt; 0.0001). Our data suggest that serum BDNF may be associated with effects of increased CRF on cardiovascular disease. However, more research is clearly needed before a determination of whether, and to what extent, serum BDNF may be responsible for some of the health benefits associated with CRF.

10.4088/JCP.18m12612	Prenatal Exposure to Acetaminophen and the Risk of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A Nationwide Study in Taiwan.	Chen MH; Pan TL; Wang PW; Hsu JW; Huang KL; Su TP; Li CT; Lin WC; Tsai SJ; Chen TJ; Bai YM	BACKGROUND: Studies have suggested that a significant association exists between prenatal exposure to acetaminophen and the offspring&#x27;s attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) risk. However, this association has largely been unexplored among the Asian population, generally, and the Taiwanese population, specifically. METHODS: In our study, 950 study pairs (children with ADHD [ICD-9-CM code: 314] and their mothers) and 3,800 control pairs (children without ADHD and their mothers) matched by demographic characteristics were identified between 1998 and 2008 from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database. Maternal use of acetaminophen was assessed in the first trimester, second trimester, and third trimester of pregnancy and over the period from 3 months before pregnancy to the date of last menstrual cycle. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis with adjustments for demographic data, gestational infections, comorbid perinatal conditions, and maternal mental health disorders indicated that exposure to acetaminophen in the second trimester (odds ratio [OR] = 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00-1.40), both the first and second trimesters (OR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.00-1.64), or in any trimester (OR = 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.42) was associated with an increased risk of ADHD in offspring. Sensitivity analysis excluding gestational infections and maternal mental health disorders confirmed this association (OR = 1.33; 95% CI, 1.04-1.69). CONCLUSION: Prenatal exposure to acetaminophen was associated with an increased risk of ADHD in offspring, regardless of gestational infections and maternal mental health disorders. Additional studies are necessary to clarify the underlying mechanisms by which prenatal exposure to acetaminophen leads to neurodevelopmental risks.	J Clin Psychiatry	10/09/2019
10.1038/s41591-025-03937-8	Co-infusion of CD19-targeting and BCMA-targeting CAR-T cells for treatment-refractory systemic lupus erythematosus: a phase 1 trial.	Feng J; Huo D; Hong R; Jin X; Cao H; Shao M; Wen R; Zhang Q; Zhang M; Fu S; Wang D; Xu H; Wei G; Cui J; Huang S; Cui D; Chang AH; Liu Z; Lu L; Lin J; Hu Y; Huang H	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains refractory to conventional immunosuppression in a subset of patients. In treatment-refractory SLE, we show that peripheral CD19(⁺) B cells and bone marrow CD19⁻BCMA⁺ long-lived plasma cells are dominant autoantibody sources, motivating dual CD19 and BCMA targeting. Here we report results from a cohort of patients (14 female, one male) in an ongoing phase 1 dose-escalation trial of co-infused autologous anti-CD19 and anti-BCMA chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells after fludarabine/cyclophosphamide lymphodepletion. Primary endpoints were dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) within 28 days and adverse events within 12 weeks; key secondary endpoints comprised attainment of Lupus Low Disease Activity State (LLDAS) and DORIS remission within 12 weeks and in vivo CAR-T persistence within 24 weeks. Exploratory endpoints were the duration of post-infusion B cell depletion and time to recovery, the kinetics of immune reconstitution and longitudinal changes in autoantibody titers and serum immunoglobulin concentrations after CAR-T therapy. Over a median 712-day follow-up (range, 613-1,134), no DLTs occurred. Grade 1 cytokine release syndrome developed in 86.7% of patients, with no neurotoxicity or treatment-related deaths. The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events were neutropenia (100%), thrombocytopenia (40%) and anemia (13.3%), all of which were reversible with supportive care. By week 12, 12 of 15 patients (80%) fulfilled both the LLDAS and DORIS remission criteria. Multiomic analyses confirmed elimination of autoreactive CD19⁺BCMA⁺ clones, reconstitution of naive IgM/IgD B cells and durable downregulation of interferon-stimulated and BAFF-dependent signatures, indicating improved immune homeostasis. Longitudinal monitoring of three patients for 1 year demonstrated sustained eradication of pathogenic clones, suggesting potential cure. Dual anti-CD19/anti-BCMA CAR-T cell therapy demonstrates good safety and promising clinical efficacy in treatment-refractory SLE. This study supports the further development of this treatment approach for patients with rSLE. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05030779 .	Nat Med	24/09/2025
10.1136/gutjnl-2025-335642	Alleviated T cell exhaustion and SLC1A3-mediated stroma-remodelling dictate chemoimmunotherapy efficacy in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.	Xiang S; Chen Y; Wang C; Wang M; He Y; Liu Z; Zhang JL; Yang LP; Wei YF; Wu QN; Wang ZX; Xi SY; Li Z; Zhao Q; Xu RH; Wang F	BACKGROUND: Combining chemotherapy with anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) improves clinical outcomes in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), yet the underlying synergistic mechanism remains obscured. Moreover, 30-50% of patients still derive no therapeutic benefit from the combination strategy, highlighting the need to decipher and overcome resistance. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the mechanisms by which chemotherapy augments the responses to immune checkpoint blockade and elucidate the factors contributing to persistent resistance in non-responding patients. DESIGN: We designed a systematic investigation involving longitudinal sampling of ESCC tissues both from patients treated with chemotherapy plus anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-1 monotherapy. The tumour microenvironment (TME) was then comprehensively characterised using single-cell transcriptomics, T cell receptor repertoire analysis, multiplex immunohistochemistry and murine models. RESULTS: We demonstrated that combination therapy exerted superior antitumour efficacy by mitigating immune checkpoint engagements (TIGIT-NECTIN2 and NECTIN1-CD96) between epithelial-stress tumour cells and CD8(+) T cells, thereby preventing T cells from exhaustion and boosting vitality. In non-responders, we identified a subset of tumour cells with high SLC1A3 expression, which localised at the tumour boundary and interacted with COL1A1(+) myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts, inducing an extracellular matrix-enriched TME that hindered the infiltration of CD8(+) T cells. Inhibiting SLC1A3 significantly enhanced the efficacy of chemotherapy plus anti-PD-1, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target. CONCLUSION: This study elucidates the synergistic mechanisms and identifies key resistance pathways underlying chemo-immunotherapy combinations in patients with ESCC, providing a scientific basis for refining future combination therapeutic regimens.

10.1038/s41418-025-01587-4	AARS1-mediated lactylation of H3K18 and STAT1 promotes ferroptosis in diabetic nephropathy.	Hong J; Xu H; Yu L; Yu Z; Chen X; Meng Z; Zhu J; Li J; Zhu M	Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the primary cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. Recent studies have revealed that lactate-mediated histone lactylation, which functions as a novel epigenetic modification, is involved in the occurrence and development of diabetes-related complications. However, little is known about the role of lactyltransferase in DN. Alanyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (AARS1) was identified as a novel lactyltransferase that modulates histone H3-lysine-18 lactylation (H3K18la). In the present study, we determined whether AARS1-mediated H3K18la participates in the pathogenesis of DN. More importantly, we explored the potential mechanism involved. A mouse DN model consisting of both wild-type and alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS1) heterozygote (AARS1(+/-)) mice was utilized in this study. Transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses, combined with a variety of molecular biological methodologies, were employed to elucidate the potential mechanism by which AARS1 regulates ferroptosis in DN. Our results indicated that the increases in AARS1 and H3K18la expression were involved in kidney dysfunction and renal cell death via the modulation of ferroptosis in the DN model. Moreover, AARS1 induced lipid peroxidation by increasing fatty acid elongase-5 (ELOVL5) transcription, ultimately contributing to ferroptosis induction. Furthermore, AARS1 interacted with signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) to jointly regulate ELOVL5 transcription. Additionally, treatment with the STAT1-specific inhibitor fludarabine delayed DN progression. In addition, we observed that AARS1 modulated the lactylation of both STAT1 and H3K18 to regulate ELOVL5 transcription, thus triggering ferroptosis. Inhibition of AARS1-induced lactylation via β-alanine attenuated ferroptosis in DN model mice and hyperglycaemic cells. The present study showed that AARS1 induced the lactylation of H3K18 and STAT1 to regulate ELOVL5 transcription, thus triggering ferroptosis in a diabetic nephropathy model.

Despite its unique anatomical connection to the brain, the role of the nasal microbiome in neurological diseases is understudied. Here, using human data and experiments in mice, we show that nasal Staphylococcus aureus is linked to depression. Nasal microbiome analyses revealed a positive correlation between depression scores and S. aureus abundance among patients with depression and healthy controls. Metabolomics of the nasal cavity showed decreased sex hormones, estradiol and testosterone in patients with depression versus controls. Nasal microbiota transplants from patients reproduced depression-like behaviour in mice with differential abundance of S. aureus. Further homology and mutational analysis uncovered an S. aureus sex hormone-degrading enzyme, 17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Hsd12), which degraded testosterone and estradiol in mice, leading to lower levels of dopamine and serotonin in the murine brain. These findings reveal a nasal commensal that influences depressive behaviour and provides insights into the nose-brain axis.	Nat Microbiol	22/09/2025
10.1038/s41392-025-02391-9	Ninjurin-1 mediates cell lysis and detrimental inflammation of PANoptosis during influenza A virus infection.	Xu Y; Zheng Y; Liu Y; Wei C; Ren J; Zuo W; Gu R; Liu H; Deng X; Liu Y; Shang X; Ge W; Li Z; Huang Y; He D; Shen X; Wang Z; Lyu C; Wang Z; Mu Y; Zhang Z; Wu H; Li H; Cao B	Influenza A virus (IAV) induces ZBP1-mediated PANoptosis, a form of lytic inflammatory cell death characterized by concurrent activation of the pyroptosis, necroptosis and apoptosis pathways. Ninjurin-1 (NINJ1) is a recently identified mediator of plasma membrane rupture but functions diversely in different types of cell death. However, little is known about the role of NINJ1 in IAV-induced PANoptosis and viral pneumonia. Here, we report that IAV infection triggered an increase in the expression of NINJ1, which then oligomerized and mediated cell lysis in infected macrophages. The deficiency of NINJ1 prevented plasma membrane rupture and the release of DAMPs and IL-1β without affecting the progression of cell death. Activation of any single PANoptosis pathway was sufficient to trigger the oligomerization of NINJ1 and robust cell lysis. Accordingly, only when all PANoptosis pathways were concurrently blocked could the oligomerization of NINJ1, cell death, and cell rupture be prevented. Ablation of NINJ1 in vivo also alleviated IAV-induced lung injury and mortality. Furthermore, we revealed an association between NINJ1 upregulation and poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Collectively, our findings indicate a pivotal role of NINJ1 in the immunopathology of IAV infection and its potential as a bioindicator of disease severity and prognosis in viral pneumonia and viral sepsis.

10.1089/rej.2012.1389	Protective effects of ginger root extract on Alzheimer disease-induced behavioral dysfunction in rats.	Zeng GF; Zhang ZY; Lu L; Xiao DQ; Zong SH; He JM	The aim of this study was to assess the ability of a traditional Chinese medicinal ginger root extract (GRE) to prevent behavioral dysfunction in the Alzheimer disease (AD) rat model. Rat AD models were established by an operation (OP) in which rats were treated with a one-time intra-cerebroventricuIar injection of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) and continuous gavage of aluminum chloride every day for 4 weeks. GRE was administered intra-gastrically to rats. After 35 days, learning and memory were assessed in all of the rats. Brain sections were processed for immunohistochemistry and Hematoxylin &amp; Eosin (H&amp;E) and Nissl staining. The latency to show significant memory deficits was shorter in the group that received OP with a high dose of GRE (HG)(OP+HG) than in the groups that received OP with a low or moderate dose of GRE (LG, MG)(OP+LG, OP+MG) (p&lt;0.05). The expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the OP+MG and OP+LG groups was up-regulated compared to the OP+HG groups (p&lt;0.05). The rats in the OP+HG groups had lower levels of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and malondialdehyde (MDA) expression than the rats in the OP+MG and OP+LG groups (p&lt;0.05). This experiment demonstrates that the administration of GRE reverses behavioral dysfunction and prevents AD-like symptoms in our rat model.	Rejuvenation Res	01/04/2013

Imbalanced nucleotide synthesis triggers the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to the cytosol and an innate immune response through cGAS-STING signalling(3). However, how nucleotide deficiency drives mtDNA-dependent inflammation has not been elucidated. Here we show that nucleotide imbalance leads to an increased misincorporation of ribonucleotides into mtDNA during age-dependent renal inflammation in a mouse model lacking the mitochondrial exonuclease MGME1(4), in various tissues of aged mice and in cells lacking the mitochondrial i-AAA protease YME1L. Similarly, reduced deoxyribonucleotide synthesis increases the ribonucleotide content of mtDNA in cell-cycle-arrested senescent cells. This leads to mtDNA release into the cytosol, cGAS-STING activation and the mtDNA-dependent senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which can be suppressed by exogenously added deoxyribonucleosides. Our results highlight the sensitivity of mtDNA to aberrant ribonucleotide incorporation and show that imbalanced nucleotide metabolism leads to age- and mtDNA-dependent inflammatory responses and SASP in senescence.

10.1038/s41392-025-02390-w	Spatiotemporal multi-omics analysis uncovers NAD-dependent immunosuppressive niche triggering early gastric cancer.	Gao P; Zuo C; Yuan W; Cai J; Chai X; Gong R; Yu J; Yao L; Su W; Liu Z; Lin S; Wang Y; Cai M; Ma L; Li Q; Zhou P	Understanding the cellular origins and early evolutionary dynamics that drive the initiation of carcinogenesis is critical to advancing early detection and prevention strategies. By characterizing key molecular, cellular and niche events at the precancerous tipping point of early gastric cancer (EGC), we aimed to develop more precise screening tools and design targeted interventions to prevent malignant transformation at this stage. We utilized our AI models to integrate spatial multimodal data from nine EGC endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) samples (covering sequential stages from normal to cancer), construct a spatial-temporal profile of disease progression, and identify a critical tipping point (PMC_P) characterized by an immune-suppressive microenvironment during early cancer development. At this stage, inflammatory pit mucous cells with stemness (PMC_2) interact with fibroblasts via NAMPT  ⟶  ITGA5/ITGB1 and with macrophages via AREG  ⟶  EGFR/ERBB2 signaling, fostering cancer initiation. We established gastric precancerous cell lines and organoids to demonstrate that NAMPT and AREG promote cellular proliferation in vitro. Furthermore, in the transgenic CEA-SV40 mouse model, targeting AREG and/or NAMPT disrupted key cell interactions, inhibited the JAK-STAT, MAPK, and NFκB pathways, and reduced PD-L1 expression, which was also confirmed by western blot in vitro. These interventions delayed disease progression, reversed the immunosuppressive microenvironment, and prevented malignant transformation. Clinical validation was conducted using endoscopically resected EGC specimens. Our study provides a precise spatiotemporal depiction of EGC development and identifies novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for early intervention.

10.1136/jitc-2025-012230	Lactylation-driven MVP upregulation boosts immunotherapy resistance by inhibiting PD-L1 degradation in hepatocellular carcinoma.	Liu S; Pan Y; Liu W; Bu X; Shao R; Wang Q; Wu J; Wu C; Hu W; Xu J; Wu C; Jiang J	BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged as first-line therapies for advanced HCC, substantially improving clinical outcomes. However, resistance to ICIs remains a major therapeutic challenge. Lactylation, a recently identified post-translational modification, has been implicated in tumor progression, although its role in ICIs resistance in HCC remains unclear. METHODS: Cytotoxicity assays, flow cytometry and orthotopic HCC mouse model were used to evaluate the effects of lactylation in remodeling the immune microenvironment. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA sequencing were employed to identify lactylation-regulated gene profiles. Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein degradation was assayed by cycloheximide-chase analysis and ubiquitination assay. Interactions between major vault protein (MVP) and β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP) were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Site-directed mutagenesis and truncation mutants were designed to determine binding sites of MVP-β-TrCP complex. RESULTS: Elevated lactylation correlates with poor prognosis and ICIs resistance in patients with HCC. Inhibition of lactylation enhances CD8(+) T-cell infiltration and cytokine production. Multiomics analyses identify MVP as a lactylation-regulated factor that suppresses CD8(+) T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. Elevated MVP expression is associated with resistance to checkpoint blockade therapy. Mechanistic studies reveal that histone lactylation-induced MVP upregulation stabilizes PD-L1 by preventing β-TrCP-mediated proteasomal degradation. Pharmacological inhibition of lactylation restores ICIs sensitivity in orthotopic HCC mouse models. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that histone lactylation promotes ICIs resistance via MVP-dependent PD-L1 stabilization. Therefore, targeting lactylation in combination with programmed cell death protein-1/PD-L1 blockade offers a promising strategy to overcome immunotherapy resistance in HCC.

10.1097/JS9.0000000000003476	Polyethylene terephthalate microplastics exposure enhances the risk of ulcerative colitis: insights from multi-omics integration, machine learning, and molecular docking reveal intestinal toxicity mechanisms.	Yang X; Yan B; Zhao Y; Zhou L; Liu M; Chen G; Shen L; Deng T	BACKGROUND: In recent decades, the widespread use of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has led to the proliferation of PET microplastics (PET-MPs) in the environment, posing potential threats to human health, including ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: Data sourced from public databases were harnessed to predict the targets of PET-MPs and identify UC-related differentially expressed genes. Functional enrichment analyses were conducted to uncover relevant biological pathways. Three machine learning algorithms were utilized to screen for hub genes associated with PET-MPs-induced UC, followed by the evaluation of these hub genes using eight machine learning algorithms via SHAP analysis. Subsequently, a nomogram was constructed and validated based on a Risk prediction model, and single-cell sequencing analysis and molecular docking were performed. An animal model was established via co-administration of 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and PET-MPs. Western blot analysis was employed to verify the protein expression levels in intestinal tissues. RESULTS: Eleven potential targets related to PET-MPs-induced UC toxicity were identified. Four hub genes (CTSK, NAAA, PDE4B, and PFKFB3) were successfully screened out, exhibiting significant expression disparities in UC samples. The constructed Risk prediction model demonstrated high prediction accuracy. Single-cell analysis revealed distinct expression patterns of the hub genes across different cell types, and molecular docking confirmed strong binding affinities between PET-MPs and these genes. Animal experiments revealed that the expression levels of CTSK, PDE4B, and PFKFB3 in the DSS + PET-MPs group were significantly upregulated, while the expression level of NAAA was significantly downregulated, compared with the DSS group. CONCLUSION: This study offers valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms by which PET-MPs may induce UC, providing a theoretical foundation for understanding the potential health risks associated with PET-MPs exposure.

As with other orthoflaviviruses-enveloped, arthropod-borne RNA viruses-host factors required for TBEV entry remain poorly defined. Here we used a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9-based screen to identify LRP8, an apolipoprotein E and reelin receptor with high expression in the brain, as a TBEV receptor. LRP8 downregulation reduced TBEV infection in human cells, and its overexpression enhanced infection. LRP8 bound directly to the TBEV E glycoprotein and mediated viral attachment and internalization into cells. An LRP8-based soluble decoy blocked infection of human cell lines and neuronal cells and protected mice from lethal TBEV challenge. LRP8&#x27;s role as a TBEV receptor has implications for TBEV neuropathogenesis and the development of antiviral countermeasures.	Nature	24/09/2025

Here we present CELLFIE, a CRISPR screening platform for enhancing CAR T cells across multiple clinical objectives. We performed genome-wide screens in human primary CAR T cells, with readouts capturing key aspects of T cell biology, including proliferation, target cell recognition, activation, apoptosis and fratricide, and exhaustion. Screening hits were prioritized using a new in vivo CROP-seq(2) method in a xenograft model of human leukaemia, establishing several gene knockouts that boost CAR T cell efficacy. Most notably, we discovered that RHOG knockout is a potent and unexpected CAR T cell enhancer, both individually and together with FAS knockout, which was validated across multiple in vivo models, CAR designs and sample donors, and in patient-derived cells. Demonstrating the versatility of the CELLFIE platform, we also conducted combinatorial CRISPR screens to identify synergistic gene pairs and saturation base-editing screens to characterize RHOG variants. In summary, we discovered, validated and biologically characterized CRISPR-boosted CAR T cells that outperform standard CAR T cells in widely used benchmarks, establishing a foundational resource for optimizing cell-based immunotherapies.

However, progressive loss of CAR T cells contributes to relapse in many patients(2-4). Here we performed in vivo loss-of-function CRISPR screens in CAR T cells targeting B cell maturation antigen to investigate genes that influence CAR T cell persistence and function in a human multiple myeloma model. We tracked the expansion and persistence of CRISPR library-edited T cells in vitro and at early and late time points in vivo to track the performance of gene-modified CAR T cells from manufacturing to survival in tumours. The screens revealed context-specific regulators of CAR T cell expansion and persistence. Ablation of RASA2 and SOCS1 enhanced T cell expansion in vitro, whereas loss of PTPN2, ZC3H12A and RC3H1 conferred early growth advantages to CAR T cells in vivo. Notably, we identified cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (encoded by CDKN1B), a cell cycle regulator, as the most important factor limiting CAR T cell fitness at late time points in vivo. CDKN1B ablation increased CAR T cell proliferation and effector function, significantly enhancing tumour clearance and overall survival. Our findings reveal differing effects of gene perturbation on CAR T cells over time and in different environments, highlight CDKN1B as a promising target to generate highly effective CAR T cells for multiple myeloma and underscore the potential of in vivo screening for identifying genes to enhance CAR T cell efficacy.

10.1038/s41418-025-01580-x	Induction of ferroptosis in prostate cancer by CCDC7(19-13) via TRIM21-mediated ubiquitination of SLC7A11.	Cheng B; Wang Q; Li Z; Luo T; Xie J; Singh S; Luo Y; Gao X; Li H; Wang Z; Wu P; Huang H	Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies in men, with increasing incidence and mortality largely attributed to treatment resistance and metastasis. The effectiveness of current therapies for advanced cases is hindered by intricate genetic and microenvironmental factors, emphasizing the urgent need for novel therapeutic targets. Chimeric RNAs have emerged as promising biomarkers in cancer research, among which CCDC7(19-13), a circular chimeric RNA, is frequently identified in prostate cancer. Our study reveals that CCDC7(19-13) expression is markedly reduced in advanced and recurrent prostate cancer, where its low levels serve as an independent predictor of poor prognosis. Functional experiments demonstrate that CCDC7(19-13) overexpression inhibits cell proliferation, induces apoptosis, and suppresses tumor growth in vivo, whereas its knockdown reverses these effects. Mechanistically, CCDC7(19-13) encodes a novel protein, CCDC7(241aa), which triggers ferroptosis by interacting with SLC7A11 and facilitating its TRIM21-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. Notably, treatment with recombinant CCDC7(241aa) effectively suppresses tumor growth in patient-derived xenograft models without toxicity and enhances the efficacy of docetaxel and enzalutamide in vitro. These findings establish CCDC7(19-13) as a significant prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target in prostate cancer, with the recombinant CCDC7(241aa) protein offering promise for combination therapies in advanced cases.

10.1016/j.cmet.2025.08.010	Hepatic acetyl-CoA metabolism modulates neuroinflammation and depression susceptibility via acetate.	Cao Y; Zhao Y; Deng T; Zhou Q; Hu G; Hu ZL; Jiang YY; Yang XH; Wang F; Wu PF; Chen JG	Extensive research highlights impaired brain energy metabolism in neuropsychiatric disorders, whereas much less is known about the role of the peripheral metabolic state. The liver is the metabolic hub, and herein we demonstrate that hepatic hydrolysis of acetyl-coenzyme A, a central metabolic intermediate, signals the brain and helps buffer stress. Using a chronic social defeat stress paradigm in male mice, we observed a hepatic glucose-to-acetate metabolic switch, followed by a glucocorticoid-repressed transcription of the acetyl-coenzyme A hydrolase, acetyl-coenzyme A thioesterase 12, to confer stress vulnerability. Hepatic overexpression of acetyl-coenzyme A thioesterase 12 alleviated depression-like phenotypes via increasing acetate output to promote histone acetylation in the ventral hippocampus, which bolstered the expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 in astrocytes, limiting neuroinflammation and rescuing inhibitory synaptic transmission dysfunction. Our findings demonstrate that hepatic acetyl-coenzyme A hydrolysis serves as a key liver-brain axis component that regulates depression susceptibility.	Cell Metab	23/09/2025
10.1126/science.adn8754	Lysosomes signal through the epigenome to regulate longevity across generations.	Zhang Q; Dang W; Wang MC	The epigenome is sensitive to metabolic inputs and is crucial for aging. Lysosomes act as a signaling hub to sense metabolic cues and regulate longevity. We found that lysosomal metabolic pathways signal through the epigenome to regulate transgenerational longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans. Activation of lysosomal lipid signaling and lysosomal adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or reduction of lysosomal mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling increased the expression of a histone H3.3 variant and increased its methylation on K79, leading to life-span extension across multiple generations. This transgenerational prolongevity effect required intestine-to-germline transportation of histone H3.3 and a germline-specific H3K79 methyltransferase and was recapitulated by overexpressing H3.3 or the H3K79 methyltransferase. Thus, signals from a lysosome affect the epigenome and link the soma and germ line to mediate transgenerational inheritance of longevity.	Science	25/09/2025
10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf742	Shear stress-induced endothelial HEG1 signalling regulates vascular tone and blood pressure.	Wu W; Liu J; Chen X; Zhu P; Xu J; Yue J; Liu X; Fang J; Chen X; Pi J; Zheng L; Zhang Q; Zhang L; Schneider CV; Schneider KM; Trautwein C; Gao P; Reilly MP; Zhang Y; Zheng X; Liu J	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endothelial cells (ECs) sense flow shear stress for vasodilation, a crucial mechanism for maintaining systemic blood pressure (BP). Impaired shear stress signalling contributes to endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. Heart development protein with EGF-like domain 1 (HEG1), a flow-sensitive, endothelial-derived protein, is inversely associated with cardiovascular risks. This study aimed to elucidate the role of endothelial HEG1 in BP regulation and the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Phenome-wide association study, computational fluid dynamics analysis, single-cell RNA sequencing, artery and plasma samples from independent cohorts, and in vitro shear stress analysis were used to assess the association between hypertension, shear stress, and HEG1 levels. Endothelial-specific Heg1 deletion mice, BP monitoring, and vascular function analysis were employed to characterize the roles of EC-HEG1 in endothelial function and hypertension. Proteomics, transcriptomics, and ubiquitination assays were used to identify the regulatory pathways involved. RESULTS: Plasma HEG1 levels were down-regulated in hypertensive subjects due to reduced wall shear stress on the endothelium, which diminished HEG1 expression and its release into circulation. Endothelial-specific Heg1 deletion in mice resulted in elevated BP, impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, and hypertensive levels especially in an ApoeKO dyslipidaemia background. Mechanistically, HEG1 facilitated CUL3-mediated degradation of PHACTR1. HEG1 deletion led to increased PHACTR1 levels, nuclear translocation, and suppression of SP1-mediated eNOS transcription and NO production. Inhibition of PHACTR1 nuclear localization by CCG-1423 prevented impaired vasodilation and hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies a novel shear-sensitive endothelial HEG1 signalling pathway in BP regulation, providing potential therapeutic targets for hypertension.	Eur Heart J	23/09/2025

Like all cancers, its growth is fuelled by metabolites obtained from either circulation or local biosynthesis(3,4). Neuroblastomas depend on local polyamine biosynthesis, and the inhibitor difluoromethylornithine has shown clinical activity(5). Here we show that such inhibition can be augmented by dietary restriction of upstream amino acid substrates, leading to disruption of oncogenic protein translation, tumour differentiation and profound survival gains in the Th-MYCN mouse model. Specifically, an arginine- and proline-free diet decreases the amount of the polyamine precursor ornithine and enhances tumour polyamine depletion by difluoromethylornithine. This polyamine depletion causes ribosome stalling, unexpectedly specifically at codons with adenosine in the third position. Such codons are selectively enriched in cell cycle genes and low in neuronal differentiation genes. Thus, impaired translation of these codons, induced by combined dietary and pharmacological intervention, favours a pro-differentiation proteome. These results suggest that the genes of specific cellular programmes have evolved hallmark codon usage preferences that enable coherent translational rewiring in response to metabolic stresses, and that this process can be targeted to activate differentiation of paediatric cancers.

10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2025.2579	Soft Drink Consumption and Depression Mediated by Gut Microbiome Alterations.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between soft drink consumption and MDD diagnosis and severity and whether this association is mediated by changes in the gut microbiota, particularly Eggerthella and Hungatella abundance. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter cohort study was conducted in Germany using cross-sectional data from the Marburg-Münster Affective Cohort. Patients with MDD and healthy controls (aged 18-65 years) recruited from the general population and primary care between September 2014 and September 2018 were analyzed. Data analyses were conducted between May and December 2024. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary analyses included multivariable regression and analysis of variance (ANOVA) models examining the association between soft drink consumption and MDD diagnosis and symptom severity, controlling for site and education, and Eggerthella and Hungatella abundance, controlling for site, education, and library size. Mediation analyses tested whether microbiota abundance mediated the soft drink-MDD link. RESULTS: A total of 405 patients with MDD (275 female patients [67.9%]; mean [SD] age, 36.37 [13.33] years) and 527 healthy controls (345 female controls [65.5%]; mean [SD] age, 35.33 [13.13] years) were included. Soft drink consumption predicted MDD diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.081; 95% CI, 1.008-1.159; P = .03) and symptom severity (P &lt; .001; partial η2 [ηp2], 0.012; 95% CI, 0.004-0.035), with stronger effects in women (diagnosis: OR, 1.167; 95% CI, 1.054-1.292; P = .003; severity: P &lt; .001; ηp2, 0.036; 95% CI, 0.011-0.062). In women, consumption was linked to increased Eggerthella (P = .007; ηp2, 0.017; 95% CI, 0.0002-0.068), but not Hungatella abundance. Mediation analyses confirmed that Eggerthella significantly mediated the soft drink-MDD association (diagnosis: P = .011; severity: P = .005), explaining 3.82% and 5.00% of the effect, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, it was found that soft drink consumption may contribute to MDD through gut microbiota alterations, notably involving Eggerthella. Public health strategies to reduce soft drink intake may help mitigate depression risk, especially among vulnerable populations; in addition, interventions for depression targeting the microbiome composition appear promising.

10.1126/science.adj9141	Dynamic U2AF cycling defines two phases of cotranscriptional pre-mRNA splicing.	Shao C; Hao Y; Jiang L; Wang D; Wang R; Li Y; Wang H; Ge Y; Bai R; Du X; Chen X; Wu T; Gou LT; Wan R; Xu Y; Ji X; Fu XD	Distinguishing functional splice sites from abundant cryptic sites in precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) represents a fundamental challenge in decoding mammalian genomes. We demonstrate that the specific RNA polymerase II (Pol II) subunit RPB9 directly interacts with the 3&#x27; AG dinucleotide binding factor U2AF1 to initiate 3&#x27; splice site recognition. Combined with recent structural insights into Pol II-mediated 5&#x27; splice site selection, these findings support a cotranscriptional mechanism to recognize paired 3&#x27; and 5&#x27; splice sites across individual exons. These initial exon definition events facilitate the recruitment of U2AF2 to heterodimerize with U2AF1, which also triggers U2AF1 release from elongating Pol II. Collectively, these results reveal dynamic U2AF cycling that partitions Pol II subunit-facilitated splice site recognition and subsequent Pol II-independent spliceosome assembly steps during cotranscriptional splicing.

10.1038/cgt.2010.39	Ribozyme-mediated compensatory induction of menin-oncosuppressor function in primary fibroblasts from MEN1 patients.	Luzi E; Marini F; Tognarini I; Carbonell Sala S; Galli G; Falchetti A; Brandi ML	Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome is characterized by the occurrence of tumors of parathyroids, neuroendocrine cells of the gastro-enteropancreatic tract and anterior pituitary. MEN1 gene encodes menin-oncosuppressor protein. Loss of heterozygosity at 11q13 is typical of MEN1 tumors. We have analyzed the MEN1 mRNA and menin expression in fibroblasts from normal skin biopsies and from MEN1 patients (two with a frameshift 738del4 (exon 3) mutation, introducing a premature stop codon, and an individual with an R460X (exon 10) nonsense mutation). The expression of full-length menin protein did not differ between MEN1 and normal fibroblasts. Wild-type alleles mRNAs were expressed in MEN1 patients, whereas mutant alleles were partially degraded by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway, suggesting a mechanism of compensation for allelic loss by the up-regulation of wild-type menin expression at a post-transcriptional level. Small-interfering RNA silencing of the wild-type mRNA allele abolished menin compensation, whereas the ribozyme silencing of the MEN1-mutated mRNA allele resulted in strongly enhanced wild-type menin expression. Gel-retardation analysis showed that in vitro-specific RNA-protein complexes bound to MEN1 mRNA. These findings contribute to the understanding of tumorigenesis in MEN1, offering the basis for the development of RNA-based therapies in MEN1 gene mutation carriers.	Cancer Gene Ther	01/11/2010
10.1038/s41579-025-01237-z	Fusobacterium nucleatum: ecology, pathogenesis and clinical implications.	Jiang SS; Chen YX; Fang JY	Fusobacterium nucleatum, a commensal microorganism and opportunistic pathogen (a pathobiont), has emerged as a key player in both local and systemic diseases. In humans, F. nucleatum is found in the oral microbiota, but under certain conditions, it can spread to other ecological niches within the body, such as the gut microbiota. Importantly, F. nucleatum has a pathogenic role in periodontal disease, inflammatory bowel disease and various cancers, particularly colorectal cancer. F. nucleatum can promote oncogenesis via several mechanisms, including virulence factors, chronic inflammation, immune evasion and direct interactions with tumour cells. The strong link between this pathobiont microorganism and cancer has led to the emergence of several potential diagnostic strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. Given its increasing association with cancer progression and poor clinical outcomes, understanding the role of F. nucleatum in disease treatment offers critical insights for future research and clinical applications. This Review underscores the importance of F. nucleatum in microbiology, oncology and translational medicine.	Nat Rev Microbiol	22/09/2025

However, currently, no nasal spray COVID-19 vaccines are approved by WHO for global use. Here we develop a two-component intranasal vaccine that combines an adenovirus vector expressing the spike protein of the XBB.1.5 variant (Ad5(XBB.1.5)) with a self-assembled trimeric recombinant protein derived from the receptor binding domain (RBD(XBB.1.5)-HR). This two-component vaccine elicits superior humoral and cellular immunity against XBB.1.5 variants compared with the individual components. It also provides protective immunity against live XBB.1.16 virus challenges in mice, and prevents XBB.1.5 virus transmission in a hamster model. Notably, the activation of the STING signalling pathway in mucosal dendritic cells is essential for the adjuvant effect of the adenovirus vector. We also incorporate another trimeric protein from the BA.5 variant (RBD(BA.5)-HR), creating a three-component vaccine (Ad5(XBB.1.5) + RBD(XBB.1.5)-HR + RBD(BA.5)-HR) that shows enhanced broad-spectrum neutralization. The two-component vaccine demonstrates high tolerability and safety in humans, inducing enhanced mucosal immunity and high levels of neutralizing antibodies in all participants.

McDade EM; Barthélemy NR; Wang G; Li Y; Cao Y; Gordon B; Benzinger TLS; Clifford D; Goate AM; Renton AE; Hassenstab J; Llibre-Guerra JJ; Perrin RJ; Xiong C; Cruchaga C; Mummery CJ; Berman SB; Lah J; Roberson ED; Van Dyck C; Gauthier S; Masters CL; Masellis M; Bittner T; Yaari R; Chhatwal J; Chrem P; Brooks W; Suzuki K; Levin JJ; Jucker M; Ringman J; Wallon D; Ikeuchi T; Lee JH; Roh JH; Schofield P; Fox NC; Ryan NS; Vöglein J; Karch C; Ibáñez L; Day GS; Sánchez-Valle R; Daniels A; Morris JC; Supnet-Bell C; Levey AI; Bateman RJ	BACKGROUND: Tau-derived cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers correlate with amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques or tau tangles in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD). This study assessed the effects of long-term anti-Aβ antibodies on amyloid plaques, tau tangles, and CSF tau species to determine the relationships between them. METHODS: A post-hoc analysis of the DIAN-TU-001 trial (NCT01760005) examined 142 participants at risk for dominantly inherited AD randomized to solanezumab (n = 50), gantenerumab (n = 52), or placebo (n = 40). High-resolution mass spectrometry quantified CSF tau species over four years. RESULTS: Phosphorylated tau (p-tau) species (153, 181, 217, 231) increased early in preclinical AD but were reduced with gantenerumab-mediated Aβ plaque reduction. Nearly a decade later, MTBR-tau243 and p-tau205 increased, showing no association with Aβ reduction, aligning with tau tangle pathology progression. DISCUSSION: Initially changing soluble p-tau species track Aβ plaque reduction, while ptau205 and MTBR-243 reflect tau tangle pathology, informing different pathways of therapeutic strategies. HIGHLIGHTS: p-tau217 and p-tau231 correlate with Aβ-PET and respond to Aβ-plaque lowering therapies. Aβ immunotherapy trials support a direct link between p-tau changes and Aβ plaques Gantenerumab reduces Aβ plaques but does not affect tau NFT-related biomarkers. Blood-based p-tau217 assays may provide a non-invasive tool to monitor Aβ therapies. MTBR-tau243 strongly correlates with tau PET and tracks NFT pathology progression. Further studies are needed to validate tau biomarkers for tracking NFT-targeting therapies.	Alzheimers Dement	01/09/2025
10.1038/s41467-025-63935-9	Comparative single-cell and spatial profiling of anti-SSA-positive and anti-centromere-positive Sjögren&#x27;s disease reveals common and distinct immune activation and fibroblast-mediated inflammation.	Inamo J; Takeshita M; Suzuki K; Tsunoda K; Usuda S; Kuramoto J; Moody J; Hon CC; Ando Y; Sasaki T; Yoshitake K; Mitsuyama S; Asakawa S; Kanai Y; Takeuchi T; Kaneko Y	Sjögren&#x27;s disease (SjD) is an autoimmune disease that causes salivary gland dysfunction due to immune-mediated destruction. While autoantibodies such as anti-SSA and anti-centromere (CENT) are associated with distinct clinical manifestations, the molecular features remain to be elucidated. In this study, we apply multi-modal single-cell technologies: single-cell RNA sequencing, T cell and B cell receptor sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to salivary gland lesions, aiming to elucidate common and unique cellular and transcriptional signatures linked to different autoantibody profiles. Our analysis demonstrates that GZMB(+)GNLY(+) CD8(+) T cells are the main expanded subset across different autoantibody statuses, highlighting their central role in SjD pathogenesis, while the enrichment of memory B cells is more prominent in anti-CENT-positive patients. Cytokine signaling also differs by autoantibody profile, with an activated interferon signature in anti-SSA-positive patients, whereas TGFβ signaling is enhanced in anti-CENT-positive patients. Furthermore, spatial profiling reveals THY1(+) fibroblasts, expressing complement genes and chemokines, as key hubs orchestrating inflammation within the salivary glands. These findings deepen our understanding of the pathogenesis of SjD, and may inform the development of targeted and personalized therapeutic strategies.	Nat Commun	22/09/2025
10.1371/journal.pmed.1004722	Association between lower fasting plasma glucose levels during oral glucose tolerance test and adverse perinatal outcomes: A Chinese cohort study.	Wang L; Tang C; Cheng M; Hao Y; Chen S; Zhang S; Zhang C; Mol BW; Wu Y; Huang H	BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level within the normal range as defined by the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria is associated with perinatal outcomes. This study explored the associations between FPG levels lower than the IADPSG threshold during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and adverse perinatal outcomes in women with or without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS AND FINDINGS: From January 1, 2017, to May 31, 2022, this single-center retrospective cohort study included 33,417 women with singleton pregnancies at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China. All women underwent a 75-g OGTT at 24-28 gestational weeks. The primary endpoint was a composite of adverse outcomes, including gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, fetal death and stillbirth, preterm birth, primary cesarean delivery, and small or large for gestational age. Overall, 3,108 (9.5%) women had IADPSG-defined GDM and of whom 2,426 (76.3%) had FPG levels below the IADPSG threshold. Compared to the GDM population, non-GDM women with borderline-normal FPG levels were at significantly greater risk of adverse outcomes with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 1.62 (95% CI [1.20, 2.19]; p = 0.002) at 4.6 mmol/L, an aOR of 1.50 (95% CI [1.05, 2.13]; p = 0.025) at 4.8 mmol/L, and an aOR of 1.58 (95% CI [1.05, 2.40]; p = 0.030) at 4.9 mmol/L glucose level. Nonetheless, non-GDM women demonstrated significantly lower risk (aOR 0.66, 95% CI [0.44, 0.98]; p = 0.038) compared to GDM counterparts exhibiting low fasting glycemia at 3.9 mmol/L. However, this study was limited by its retrospective design and may lack generalizability to other ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Even at FPG levels lower than the IADPSG threshold, FPG was significantly associated with adverse perinatal outcomes, and the associations presented different patterns in women with and without GDM.

10.1056/NEJMoa2504650	Low-Dose Aspirin for PI3K-Altered Localized Colorectal Cancer.	Martling A; Hed Myrberg I; Nilbert M; Grönberg H; Granath F; Eklund M; Öresland T; Iversen LH; Haapamäki C; Janson M; Westberg K; Segelman J; Ersson U; Prytz M; Angenete E; Bergström R; Mayrhofer M; Glimelius B; Lindberg J	BACKGROUND: Aspirin reduces the incidence of colorectal adenoma and colorectal cancer among high-risk persons. Observational studies suggest that aspirin may also improve disease-free survival after diagnosis, particularly among patients with tumors harboring somatic PIK3CA mutations. However, data from randomized trials are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with stage I, II, or III rectal cancer or stage II or III colon cancer with somatic alterations in PI3K pathway genes. The patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 160 mg of aspirin or matched placebo once daily for 3 years. Patients with prespecified PIK3CA hotspot mutations in exon 9 or 20 (group A alterations) and those with other moderate- or high-impact somatic variants in PIK3CA, PIK3R1, or PTEN (group B alterations) were eligible for randomization. The primary end point was colorectal cancer recurrence, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, in patients with group A alterations. Secondary end points included colorectal cancer recurrence in patients with group B alterations, disease-free survival, and safety. RESULTS: Alterations in PI3K pathway genes were detected in 1103 of 2980 patients (37.0%) with complete genomic data. Of 515 patients with group A alterations and 588 patients with group B alterations, 314 and 312, respectively, were assigned to receive aspirin or placebo. The estimated 3-year cumulative incidence of recurrence was 7.7% with aspirin and 14.1% with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24 to 0.98; P = 0.04) among patients with group A alterations and 7.7% and 16.8%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.83), among those with group B alterations. The estimated 3-year disease-free survival was 88.5% with aspirin and 81.4% with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.34 to 1.08) among patients with group A alterations and 89.1% and 78.7%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.88), among those with group B alterations. Severe adverse events occurred in 16.8% of aspirin recipients and 11.6% of placebo recipients. CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin led to a significantly lower incidence of colorectal cancer recurrence than placebo among patients with PIK3CA hotspot mutations in exon 9 or 20 and appeared to have a similar benefit among those with other somatic alterations in PI3K pathway genes.

10.1158/2159-8290.CD-25-0323	Development and Prospective Validation of a Cell-free DNA-based Model for the Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer.	Wang X; Wang H; Zhang M; Li H; Liu Y; Huang H; Pei J; Huang J; Zang F; Zhang Y; Chen X; Gao S; Zhao T; Wang J; Ma W; Liang Y; Shi S; Li S; Li W; Zhou T; Zhang Y; Cui X; Ye ZX; Sun Y; Peng L; Hu X; Li Z; Zhang H; Zhu D; Chang S; Zhang J; Yang R; Bao H; Wu X; Shao Y; Yu J; Gao C; Cui Y; Hao J	Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains a highly lethal malignancy due to late-stage diagnosis and limited therapeutic options. This study presents the development and validation of a non-invasive circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA)-based model for early PC detection. In a case-control study comprising 232 PC patients and 235 healthy controls, the model demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy (AUC=0.9799 in training; 0.9622 in validation). A prospective cohort study involving 1,926 individuals with diabetes and obesity, established risk factors for PC, further assessed its clinical applicability. The model detected 75% of PC cases, including all Stage 0 patients, with a lead time of up to 298 days, significantly outperforming CA19-9. Additionally, it demonstrates potential for distinguishing high-risk from low-risk pancreatic cysts, thereby facilitating more precise risk stratification. This study highlights the potential of cfDNA-based screening as a scalable, non-invasive tool for early PC detection, warranting further large-scale clinical validation to enhance patient outcomes.

10.1038/s41593-025-02056-4	A bottom-up septal inhibitory circuit mediates anticipatory control of drinking.	Xu L; Sun Y; Huang C; Zheng Y; Chen J; Ma X; Shi Q; Liu M; Qiu X; Zhao Q; Gao C; Liao J; Wang Y; Chen Z	Drinking behavior is not only homeostatically regulated but also rapidly adjusted before any changes in blood osmolality occur, known as anticipatory thirst satiation. Homeostatic and anticipatory signals converge in the subfornical organ (SFO); however, the neural pathways conveying peripheral information to the SFO before changes in blood composition are incompletely understood. Here we reveal an inhibitory pathway from the medial septum (MS) to the SFO that is involved in the control of anticipatory drinking behavior in mice. MS γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons encode water-satiation signals by integrating cues from the oral cavity and tracking gastrointestinal signals. These neurons receive inputs from the parabrachial nucleus and relay to SFO(CaMKII) neurons, forming a bottom-up pathway with activity that prevents overhydration. Disruption of this circuit leads to excessive water intake and hyponatremia. Our findings reveal a septal pathway that integrates multiple layers of presystemic signals to fine-tune drinking behavior.	Nat Neurosci	22/09/2025

To facilitate comparative lipidomic research across brain diseases, we establish a data common named the Neurolipid Atlas that we prepopulated with isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS cell)-derived lipidomics data for different brain diseases. Additionally, the resource contains lipidomics data of human and mouse brain tissue. Leveraging multiple datasets, we demonstrate that iPS cell-derived neurons, microglia and astrocytes exhibit distinct lipid profiles that recapitulate in vivo lipotypes. Notably, the Alzheimer disease (AD) risk gene ApoE4 drives cholesterol ester (CE) accumulation specifically in human astrocytes and we also observe CE accumulation in whole-brain lipidomics from persons with AD. Multiomics interrogation of iPS cell-derived astrocytes revealed that altered cholesterol metabolism has a major role in astrocyte immune pathways such as the immunoproteasome and major histocompatibility complex class I antigen presentation. Our data commons, available online ( https://neurolipidatlas.com/ ), allows for data deposition by the community and provides a user-friendly tool and knowledge base for a better understanding of lipid dyshomeostasis in neurodegenerative diseases.

Using measurements of respiratory gas exchange, indirect calorimetry can provide non-invasive estimates of whole-body energy expenditure. However, inconsistent measurement units and flawed data normalization methods have slowed progress in this field. This guide aims to establish consensus standards to unify indirect calorimetry experiments and their analysis for more consistent, meaningful and reproducible results. By establishing community-driven standards, we hope to facilitate data comparison across research datasets. This advance will allow the creation of an in-depth, machine-readable data repository built on shared standards. This overdue initiative stands to markedly improve the accuracy and depth of efforts to interrogate mammalian metabolism. Data sharing according to established best practices will also accelerate the translation of basic findings into clinical applications for metabolic diseases afflicting global populations.

10.1038/s41392-025-02399-1	An aptamer-drug conjugate for promising cancer therapy with comprehensive evaluation from rodents to non-human primates.	Su M; Liu Y; Lin H; Wang X; Ying D; Zhang L; Yang C; Jiang M; Xu L; Wang X; Sun Y; Xu H; Zhang Z; Wang X; Fu T; Xie S; He J; Liu X; Tan W	Aptamers serve as unique targeting ligands, making aptamer-drug conjugates (ApDCs) an attractive strategy for targeted cancer therapy. This study performs a comprehensive evaluation from rodents to non-human primates (NHP) of a protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7)-targeted ApDC (Sgc8c-M) made by conjugating the potent antimitotic agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) to the classic PTK7 aptamer Sgc8c. Efficacy studies in various cancer types with PTK7 overexpression showed that Sgc8c-M effectively induces sustained tumor regression in cell line-derived and patient-derived xenografts, outperforming unconjugated MMAE, the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel, and a PTK7-targeted antibody-drug conjugate. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in mice revealed that Sgc8c-M leads to rapid accumulation and sustained MMAE levels in tumors, along with fast clearance from plasma and normal tissues. Further study in rats confirmed rapid clearance across most organs and revealed that over 75% of MMAE was excreted through urine and feces within 24 h. Toxicokinetic (TK) assessments indicated comparable systemic drug exposure without accumulation for repeated doses compared to single administration. Toxicity evaluations showed that the therapeutic dose with high efficacy was safe and that the toxicity resulting from extremely high doses could be reversibly controlled. Encouraged by these findings, we evaluated PK/TK profiles and safety of Sgc8c-M in cynomolgus monkeys. Similar to PK/TK profiles observed in rats, Sgc8c-M demonstrated good dose-dependent drug exposure. It was, moreover, well tolerated in monkeys with no obvious accumulation following multiple administrations. These findings highlight the potential of Sgc8c-M as an effective antitumor agent and provide useful insights for the clinical translation of emerging ApDCs.	Signal Transduct Target Ther	24/09/2025
10.1073/pnas.2514948122	PPT1 is a negative regulator of STING signaling in cancer cells and its inhibition reactivates immune surveillance in cold tumors.	Chowdhury SR; Parikh CN; Kaur AN; DeMarco KD; Giwa HK; Mishra AK; Murphy KC; Zhou L; Ma B; Ye T; Li J; Liu H; Bai S; Johnson C; Simin K; Pitarresi JR; Zhu LJ; Watson EV; Kelliher MA; Green MR; Fitzgerald KA; Ruscetti M	Immunotherapy modalities have revolutionized cancer treatment for a number of metastatic and treatment-refractory tumor types. Still, many malignancies that lack T cell infiltration and are termed immunologically &quot;cold&quot; fail to respond to these modalities. One approach to increase tumor immunogenicity has been to induce stimulator of interferon gene (STING) and downstream interferon signaling that is often dysregulated in cold tumors. Despite some early success of STING agonists in preclinical cancer models, these approaches have not been successful in the clinic due to poor tumor penetrance and systemic toxicities. Here, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen to uncover therapeutic targets to activate STING expression in human tumors. We identified the lysosomal hydrolase Palmitoyl Protein Thioesterase1 (PPT1) as a negative regulator of STING highly expressed in cold ovarian and prostate tumors. Genetic or pharmacological PPT1 suppression increased STING protein stability and its downstream activation of interferon and inflammatory cytokine signaling to enhance T cell migration. Treatment of preclinical prostate and ovarian cancer models expressing low levels of STING with the small molecule PPT1 inhibitor GNS561 enhanced STING expression and activation, leading to infiltration and activation of cytotoxic T cells that turned these tumors &quot;hot&quot; and reduced tumor growth, fibrosis, and dissemination without toxicity. Further analysis demonstrated that PPT1 is associated with reduced STING expression, CD8(+) T cell numbers, overall survival, and immunotherapy outcomes in ovarian and prostate cancer patients. Thus, PPT1 inhibition may be a promising approach to activate STING and potentiate the effects of immunotherapy in cold tumors.	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	30/09/2025
10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf763	EP4/ANXA2 axis in pulmonary arterial hypertension: therapeutic implications.	Xu H; Ye L; Du C; Tang H; Zheng Q; Zhu C; Liang B; Wang Y; Mao X; Liang Q; Zhang J; Shao H; Sun X; Yuan R; Yun W; Luo C; Xiu J; Su W; Fan F; Dai Z; Chen L; Guan Y; Zhang X	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive condition marked by the abnormal proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), leading to significant remodelling of the pulmonary arteries (PAs). The cyclooxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid prostaglandin E2 and its receptor EP4 are crucial for maintaining vascular homeostasis. This study aimed to determine the role of EP4 in the pathogenesis of PAH and evaluate the potential of EP4 as a therapeutic target for PAH. METHODS: Two well-established PAH models, the monocrotaline-induced rat model and hypoxia/Su5416-induced mouse model, were used in this study. Both pharmacological interventions (including the EP4 antagonist grapiprant and MF498 and the agonist Cay10598) and genetic strategies (including vascular smooth muscle cell [VSMC]-specific EP4 knockout mice and VSMC-specific human EP4 transgenic mice) were used to comprehensively investigate the role of EP4 in the pathogenesis of PAH. Multiple cellular and molecular biology approaches were employed to investigate the underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: The results showed that the pharmacological blockade of the EP4 receptor and genetic deletion of the EP4 gene in VSMCs led to a significant improvement in PAH and PA remodelling. Conversely, pharmacological activation and VSMC-specific overexpression of EP4 exacerbate PAH progression. Further analysis identified annexin A2 (ANXA2) as a critical downstream mediator in EP4-induced PAH progression. Mechanistically, EP4 activation was found to enhance the translation of ANXA2 and phosphorylation of ANXA2 at Thr208 via the cAMP/PKA pathway, promoting PASMC proliferation and migration through increased nuclear translocation of β-catenin, a key signalling molecule in the canonical Wnt pathway. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of ANXA2 effectively protected PAH in rodents, suggesting its pathogenic role in PAH development. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals a crucial pathway involving EP4 and ANXA2 in PAH development and progression. Targeting EP4 and its downstream effector ANXA2 represents promising therapeutic strategies for PAH management.	Eur Heart J	25/09/2025
10.1111/epi.17410	Drug resistance in idiopathic generalized epilepsies: Evidence and concepts.	Gesche J; Beier CP	Although approximately 10%-15% of patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE)/genetic generalized epilepsy remain drug-resistant, there is no consensus or established concept regarding the underlying mechanisms and prevalence. This review summarizes the recent data and the current hypotheses on mechanisms that may contribute to drug-resistant IGE. A literature search was conducted in PubMed and Embase for studies on mechanisms of drug resistance published since 1980. The literature shows neither consensus on the definition nor a widely accepted model to explain drug resistance in IGE or one of its subsyndromes. Large-scale genetic studies have failed to identify distinct genetic causes or affected genes involved in pharmacokinetics. We found clinical and experimental evidence in support of four hypotheses: (1) &quot;network hypothesis&quot;-the degree of drug resistance in IGE reflects the severity of cortical network alterations, (2) &quot;minor focal lesion in a predisposed brain hypothesis&quot;-minor cortical lesions are important for drug resistance, (3) &quot;interneuron hypothesis&quot;-impaired functioning of γ-aminobutyric acidergic interneurons contributes to drug resistance, and (4) &quot;changes in drug kinetics&quot;-genetically impaired kinetics of antiseizure medication (ASM) reduce the effectiveness of available ASMs. In summary, the exact definition and cause of drug resistance in IGE is unknown. However, published evidence suggests four different mechanisms that may warrant further investigation.	Epilepsia	01/12/2022
10.1186/s12933-025-02826-1	The association between triglyceride-glucose index and all-cause/cardiovascular mortality in patients with different glucose metabolism statuses.	Liu J; Kang J; Liang P; Song Z; Li G; Jin X; Wu H	OBJECTIVES: The triglyceride-glucose index (TyG) is an emerging marker of metabolic health, yet its association with mortality across different glucose metabolism statuses remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the TyG and the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality among individuals with normoglycemia, dysglycemia, and diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Participants from nine cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were included and categorized into three groups: normoglycemia, dysglycemia, and diabetes. Cox regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analyses were performed to evaluate the linear and nonlinear associations between TyG and mortality. To assess the predictive power of TyG and the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) for mortality, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on age, sex, and blood pressure status. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 9.2 years, a total of 2199 all-cause deaths and 606 cardiovascular deaths were documented. In the normoglycemic group, a single standard unit increase in TyG was associated with a 35% higher risk of all-cause mortality and a 38% higher risk of cardiovascular mortality (HR: 1.35, 95% CI 1.17-1.56; HR: 1.38, 95% CI 1.04-1.84, respectively). Among participants with diabetes, RCS analysis revealed a U-shaped association between TyG and all-cause/cardiovascular mortality, with an inflection point at 9.1. No significant associations were observed in the dysglycemia group. TyG demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to the AIP for 3-year mortality in both normoglycemic and diabetic individuals. Subgroup analyses identified significant interaction effects of age and sex on the association between TyG and mortality. CONCLUSION: TyG was associated with an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death in the normoglycemic subgroup, but not in the dysglycemic subgroup. In the diabetes subgroup, the association between the TyG and mortality was nonlinear. The predictive value of TyG across different glucose metabolism statuses provides new evidence for medical practice.	Cardiovasc Diabetol	24/09/2025

Baricitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, has demonstrated efficacy in controlled clinical trials, but real-world data on its long-term effectiveness and safety remain limited. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the real-life effectiveness and safety of baricitinib 4 mg daily in Italian adult patients with severe AA over a 48-week treatment period. METHODS: We conducted a 48-week retrospective, observational, multicenter study across 27 Italian university hospitals. Adult patients (18-65 years) with severe AA (Severity of Alopecia Tool [SALT] score ≥ 50) who initiated baricitinib 4 mg daily treatment between November 2022 and October 2023 were included. Effectiveness was measured by the percentage of patients achieving SALT ≤20 at week 48. Secondary outcomes included changes in mean SALT score, trichoscopic findings, patient-reported quality of life (Skindex-16, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]), and Clinician-Reported Outcomes (ClinRO) for eyebrows and eyelashes. Adverse events were also documented. RESULTS: A total of 253 patients (66.8% females, mean age 40.0 ± 12.6 years) were included. By week 48, 63.2% achieved SALT ≤20, and 75.5% achieved SALT ≤30. The mean SALT score significantly decreased from 93.7 ± 14.1 at baseline to 26.5 ± 33.0 at week 48 (p &lt; 0.001). Trichoscopic assessment showed a decline in yellow dots (97.6%-50.2%), black dots (43.5%-9.1%), and dystrophic hairs (14.6%-4.3%), whilst regrowing hairs increased (7.1%-80.2%). Skindex-16 scores improved significantly (57.1 ± 25.0 to 30.0 ± 17.8, p &lt; 0.001), as did HADS Anxiety (8.21 ± 9.38 to 4.62 ± 4.21, p &lt; 0.001) and HADS Depression (6.36 ± 4.55 to 3.70 ± 4.11, p &lt; 0.001). Adverse events were reported in 9.4% of patients. CONCLUSION: This real-world study confirms the effectiveness of baricitinib in achieving significant hair regrowth and improving psychological well-being in severe AA patients.

10.1186/s13102-021-00259-3	The influence of athletic performance on the highest positions of the final ranking during 2017/2018 Serie A season.	Longo UG; Sofi F; Candela V; Risi Ambrogioni L; Pagliai G; Massaroni C; Schena E; Cimmino M; D&#x27;Ancona F; Denaro V	BACKGROUND: Our previous study on the 2016/2017 Serie A season showed that a greater likelihood of reaching the top positions in the Italian league &quot;Serie A&quot; seemed to be mainly related to sprint activity, goal attempts, total throws, target shots and assists. Therefore, we aim to evaluate the following season data in the same league to compare, confirm, and improve these results. METHODS: The data of all the matches played during the &quot;Serie A&quot; 2017-2018 season were obtained from the Italian soccer league. The teams&#x27; analysis was performed in terms of total distance covered in km, jogging, running and sprint activities, average speed, and match statistics (total shots, shots on target, goal attempts, assists, turnovers, and steals). RESULTS: Teams that reached the first four positions revealed a lower percentage of running (65.98 ± 1.51 vs. 66.84 ± 2.18; p &lt; 0.001), a higher percentage of jogging (25.61 ± 1.71 vs. 25.30 ± 1.97; p = 0.037) and sprint activities (8.41 ± 1.04 vs. 7.86 ± 0.82; p &lt; 0.001). Match statistics seem to be statistically different between the first four teams the other teams. The total goals are strongly associated both with the total score at the end of the championship (R = 0.906; p &lt; 0.001) and with the position in the final ranking (R = 0.850; p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that high-level teams have a lower running rate and a higher percentage of jogging and sprinting than other teams.	BMC Sports Sci Med Rehabil	25/03/2021
10.3390/biom14040437	Roles of Epigenetics and Glial Cells in Drug-Induced Autism Spectrum Disorder.	Csoka AB; El Kouhen N; Bennani S; Getachew B; Aschner M; Tizabi Y	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe deficits in social communication and interaction, repetitive movements, abnormal focusing on objects, or activity that can significantly affect the quality of life of the afflicted. Neuronal and glial cells have been implicated. It has a genetic component but can also be triggered by environmental factors or drugs. For example, prenatal exposure to valproic acid or acetaminophen, or ingestion of propionic acid, can increase the risk of ASD. Recently, epigenetic influences on ASD have come to the forefront of investigations on the etiology, prevention, and treatment of this disorder. Epigenetics refers to DNA modifications that alter gene expression without making any changes to the DNA sequence. Although an increasing number of pharmaceuticals and environmental chemicals are being implicated in the etiology of ASD, here, we specifically focus on the molecular influences of the abovementioned chemicals on epigenetic alterations in neuronal and glial cells and their potential connection to ASD. We conclude that a better understanding of these phenomena can lead to more effective interventions in ASD.	Biomolecules	03/04/2024

Zhang J; Mao P; Zhou T; Yue B; Li Y; Qiu Y; Ying K; Wang F; Chen J; Yang J	Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is a fatal disease characterized by the remodelling of pulmonary veins and haemosiderin accumulation in macrophages. Although (General Control Nonderepressible 2) GCN2 deficiency has been reported in PVOD patients, the underlying mechanism by which GCN2 deficiency affects the pulmonary venous cells and the surrounding cells, remains unclear. Here, we perform immunohistochemistry and scRNA-sequencing analyses to show that macrophages are the major population affected by GCN2 deficiency and ferroptosis pathway-related genes are upregulated in lung macrophages of PVOD patients. Treatment with the specific ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) reverses the changes in haemodynamic indices observed in Eif2ak4(K1488X/K1488X) hypoxia mice and PVOD model rats. Furthermore, GCN2 deficiency increases HMOX1 and iron levels to facilitate ferroptosis in macrophages, and enhances arterial marker expression in venous endothelial cells (VECs). Specifically, spatial transcriptome analysis shows increased expression of NRP1, KDR and EFNB2 through ETS1 in VECs from PVOD patients. Our findings suggest the potential of targeting macrophage ferroptosis as a therapeutic strategy for treating related vascular diseases, and of using NRP1/KDR/EFNB2 expression as a specific marker set for venous arterialization.

10.4088/JCP.16f10721	Use of acetaminophen (paracetamol) during pregnancy and the risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in the offspring.	Andrade C	Prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may result in compromised neurodevelopment through inflammatory and immunologic mechanisms, through predisposition to oxidative stress, and through endocrine, endogenous cannabinoid, and other mechanisms. Several small and large prospective studies have found an association between gestational acetaminophen exposure and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like behaviors, use of ADHD medication, and ADHD diagnoses in offspring during childhood; the only negative study was a small investigation that examined only one aspect of attention as an outcome. Creditably, most of the studies adjusted analyses for many (but not all) confounds associated with ADHD risk. Importantly, one pivotal study also adjusted for pain, infection, inflammation, and fever to reduce confounding by indication; this study found a dose-dependent risk. In the light of the finding of a single study that infection and fever during pregnancy by themselves do not raise the ADHD risk, it appears possible that the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy is itself responsible for the increased risk of ADHD. This suggests that acetaminophen may not be as safe in pregnancy as is widely believed. However, since fever during pregnancy may itself be associated with adverse gestational outcomes, given the present level of uncertainty about the ADHD risk with acetaminophen, it is suggested that, until more data are available, the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy should not be denied in situations in which the need for the drug is clear.

However, we have relatively limited information of their genomic characteristics and the diversity of associated microbiomes. Here we used long- and short-read sequencing on 1,479 samples from 48 tick species across eight genera from China to determine their genome and associated pathogens and microbiome. Through de novo assembly, we reconstructed 7,783 bacterial genomes representing 1,373 bacterial species, of which, 712 genomes represented 32 potentially pathogenic species. Computational analysis found nutritional endosymbionts to be prevalent and highly specific to tick genera. The microbiome genome-wide association study revealed host genetic variants linked to pathogen diversity, abundance and key biological pathways essential to tick biology, including blood-feeding and pathogen invasion. These findings provide a resource for studying the host-microbe interactions within ticks, paving the way for strategies to control tick populations and tick-borne diseases.	Nat Microbiol	23/09/2025
10.7314/apjcp.2013.14.4.2191	Equol, adiponectin, insulin levels and risk of breast cancer.	Minatoya M; Kutomi G; Asakura S; Otokozawa S; Sugiyama Y; Nagata Y; Mori M; Hirata K	Breast cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers and the leading cause of cancer death among women. Soy isoflavones have been widely studied and among all isoflavones equol has been gaining interest with regard to its relationship with breast cancer risk. Obesity has been revealed as one of the breast cancer risk factors, known to be associated with high levels of circulating insulin and decreased levels of adiponectin. Hence there have been many studies investigating relationships between insulin and adiponectin levels and breast cancer risk. Additionally recent findings have suggested that insulin and adiponectin themselves may have influence on breast cancer development, independent of obesity. In the present review, we discuss the relationships between breast cancer risk and equol, insulin and adiponectin levels, which are three important factors in our ongoing hospital-based case-control study. Herein these factors are reviewed not only from the clinical viewpoint but also from possible chemical and biological points of view which may explain clinical observations.

The cellular mechanisms by which noncaloric bioactives promote healthspan are not well understood, limiting their use in disease prevention. Here, we deploy a whole-organism, high-content screen in zebrafish to profile food-derived compounds for activation of autophagy, a cellular quality control mechanism that promotes healthy aging. We identify thymol and carvacrol as activators of autophagy and mitophagy through a transient dampening of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Chemical stabilization of thymol-induced mitochondrial depolarization blocks mitophagy activation, suggesting a mechanism originating from the mitochondrial membrane. Supplementation with thymol prevents excess liver fat accumulation in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity, improves pink-1-dependent heat stress resilience in Caenorhabditis elegans, and slows the decline of skeletal muscle performance while delaying epigenetic aging in SAMP8 mice. Thus, terpenoids from common herbs promote autophagy during aging and metabolic overload, making them attractive molecules for nutrition-based healthspan promotion.	Nat Aging	24/09/2025

Here we constructed a spatially resolved atlas of human skin fibroblasts from healthy skin and 23 skin diseases, with comparison to 14 cross-tissue diseases. We define six major skin fibroblast subtypes in health and three that are disease-specific. We characterize two fibroblast subtypes further as they are conserved across tissues and are immune-related. The first, F3: fibroblastic reticular cell-like fibroblast (CCL19(+)CD74(+)HLA-DRA(+)), is a fibroblastic reticular cell-like subtype that is predicted to maintain the superficial perivascular immune niche. The second, F6: inflammatory myofibroblasts (IL11(+)MMP1(+)CXCL8(+)IL7R(+)), characterizes early human skin wounds, inflammatory diseases with scarring risk and cancer. F6: inflammatory myofibroblasts were predicted to recruit neutrophils, monocytes and B cells across multiple human tissues. Our study provides a harmonized nomenclature for skin fibroblasts in health and disease, contextualized with cross-tissue findings and clinical skin disease profiles.	Nat Immunol	24/09/2025
10.4088/JCP.16f10637	Use of acetaminophen (paracetamol) during pregnancy and the risk of autism spectrum disorder in the offspring.	Andrade C	Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is available over the counter in most countries and is widely considered to be safe for use during pregnancy; studies report gestational exposures to acetaminophen that lie in the 46%-65% range. Acetaminophen influences inflammatory and immunologic mechanisms and may predispose to oxidative stress; these and other effects are hypothesized to have the potential to compromise neurodevelopment in the fetal and infant brain. Two ecological studies suggested that population-level trends in the use of acetaminophen were associated with trends in the incidence/prevalence of autism; one of these studies specifically examined acetaminophen use during pregnancy. One large prospective observational cohort study found that gestational exposure to acetaminophen (especially when the duration of exposure was 28 days or more) was associated with motor milestone delay, gross and fine motor impairments, communication impairment, impairments in internalizing and externalizing behaviors, and hyperactivity, all at age 3 years; however, social and emotional developmental behaviors were mostly unaffected. A very recent large cohort study with a 12.7-year follow-up found that gestational exposure to acetaminophen was associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder, but only when a hyperkinetic disorder was also present. In the light of existing data associating acetaminophen use during pregnancy and subsequent risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, this new finding suggests that the predisposition, if any, is toward the hyperkinetic syndrome rather than to autism. In summary, the empirical data are very limited, but whatever empirical data exist do not support the suggestion that the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy increases the risk of autism in the offspring.

10.1038/s41568-025-00872-1	The immune microenvironment of colorectal cancer.	Kennel KB; Greten FR	Colorectal cancer (CRC) progression depends on the close interaction of tumour cells and the tumour microenvironment (TME). Although the TME contributes to poor therapy responses and immune evasion, immune cells within the TME can be therapeutically leveraged, as exemplified by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Unfortunately, only a small subset of patients with CRC benefit from ICB therapy; those with immune-activated, microsatellite unstable CRC respond, whereas the predominant group of patients with CRC, those with microsatellite-stable tumours, do not. Although challenging, modulating the TME of CRC to convert these lowly immunogenic and immunosuppressed tumours into immune-activated tumours holds tremendous therapeutic potential. In this Review we provide an overview of the cellular and molecular components of immunity in the TME of CRCs at various stages of disease as well as the mechanisms of immunosuppression and immune evasion. We further describe how systemic and local therapies for CRC impact the tumour and systemic immune microenvironments, and how immunity could serve as a therapeutic and prognostic biomarker. Lastly, we highlight novel immunotherapeutic strategies and approaches that modulate the TME of CRCs to make them amenable to immunotherapy.	Nat Rev Cancer	22/09/2025
10.1001/jama.2025.15185	Levodopa Added to Stroke Rehabilitation: The ESTREL Randomized Clinical Trial.

Levodopa is used in stroke rehabilitation despite mixed evidence for its effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether levodopa compared with placebo, administered in addition to standardized rehabilitation based on active task-oriented training, is associated with enhanced motor recovery in patients with acute stroke. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial at 13 stroke units and centers and 11 collaborating rehabilitation centers in Switzerland. Between June 14, 2019 (first patient, first visit), and August 27, 2024 (last patient, last visit), 610 patients with acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke with clinically meaningful hemiparesis (ie, a total score of ≥3 points on the following National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale items: motor arm, motor leg, or limb ataxia) were randomized 1:1 to receive levodopa or placebo. Statistical analyses were conducted from November 2024 to August 2025. INTERVENTION: Patients received levodopa/carbidopa (100 mg/25 mg; n = 307) or placebo (n = 303) 3 times daily for 39 days, alongside standardized rehabilitation therapy based on active task-oriented training. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the adjusted mean between-group difference in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) total score (range, 0-100 points; fewer points indicate worse motor function; 6-point difference considered patient-relevant) at 3 months. RESULTS: Among the 610 participants (median [IQR] age, 73 [64-82] years; 252 [41.3%] female; median baseline FMA total score, 34 [14-54]), 28 participants died by 3 months, leaving 582 (95.4%) participants eligible for the primary analysis. At 3 months, the median (IQR) FMA total score was 68 (42-85) points in the levodopa group and 64 (44-83) points in the placebo group. The mean difference in the FMA total score between the levodopa and placebo groups was -0.90 points (95% CI, -3.78 to 1.98; P = .54). There were 126 serious adverse events in the levodopa group and 129 in the placebo group; the most common was infection (levodopa, n = 55; placebo, n = 44). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, among patients receiving inpatient rehabilitation for acute stroke, levodopa added to standardized rehabilitation did not significantly improve motor function at 3 months compared with placebo plus standardized rehabilitation. These results do not support the use of levodopa as an adjunct to rehabilitation therapy for enhancing motor recovery after acute stroke.

10.1136/vr.128.9.199	Bovine spongiform encephalopathy: epidemiological studies on the origin.	Wilesmith JW; Ryan JB; Atkinson MJ	The results of further epidemiological studies of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) support the previous findings that the onset of exposure of the cattle population to a scrapie-like agent, sufficient to result in clinical disease, occurred in 1981/82. The onset of this exposure was related to the cessation, in all but two rendering plants, of the hydrocarbon solvent extraction of fat from meat and bone meal. A further possible explanation, related to the geographical variation in the reprocessing of greaves to produce meat and bone meal, was identified for the geographical variation in the incidence of BSE.

10.1136/bmj-2025-085029	First mammography screening participation and breast cancer incidence and mortality in the subsequent 25 years: population based cohort study.	Ma Z; He W; Zhang Y; Mao X; Tapia J; Hall P; Humphreys K; Czene K	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether women who did not attend their first mammography screening invitation have a long term risk of poor screening adherence and breast cancer outcomes. DESIGN: Population based cohort study. SETTING: Stockholm, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: 432 775 women who received invitations to the Swedish Mammography Screening Programme between 1991 and 2020 and were initially invited at either 50 years of age or 40 years of age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Screening adherence, breast cancer incidence, tumour characteristics, and breast cancer mortality tracked through linkage to multiple Swedish national registers, with follow-up until 2023 (up to 25 year follow-up period). Cumulative breast cancer incidences were calculated from first screening participation. Cox proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios for breast cancer mortality; logistic regression models assessed associations with tumour characteristics by odds ratios. RESULTS: During a total of 4 940 375 person years of follow-up, 16 059 new cases of breast cancer were documented. Among women invited to their first mammography screening, 32.1% (n=138 760) did not participate. These non-participants were persistently less likely to attend subsequent screenings and were more likely have symptom detected, advanced stage breast cancer diagnosed. Specifically, compared with first screening participants, non-participants had an odds ratio of 1.53 (95% confidence interval 1.24 to 1.88) for stage III cancer (160 (4.1%) v 266 (2.9%) cases) and 3.61 (2.79 to 4.68) for stage IV cancer (150 (3.9%) v 105 (1.2%) cases). During a total of 6 818 686 person years of follow-up, 1603 deaths from breast cancer were documented. Non-participation at first screening was also associated with significantly higher breast cancer mortality, with a 25 year cumulative mortality of 9.9 per 1000 versus 7.0 per 1000 for participants (adjusted hazard ratio 1.40, 95% confidence interval 1.26 to 1.55). By contrast, the 25 year breast cancer incidence was similar between groups (7.8% in participants versus 7.6% in non-participants), suggesting that the elevated mortality among first screening non-participants likely reflects delayed detection rather than increased incidence. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that first screening non-participants represent a large population at long term risk of dying from breast cancer, providing an opportunity for targeted interventions to improve adherence to screening and thereby decrease mortality risk.

While intensity as a steady-state signal is widely used, the time-resolved (tr) signal using fluorescence lifetime remains underexplored. Herein, we present a family of time-resolved fluorescent proteins (tr-FPs) with rationally controlled lifetimes. Using a strategy that regulates lifetime without affecting the spectra of FPs, we have developed a series of tr-FPs that cover the visible spectrum and a wide range of lifetimes. The tr-FPs are employed in temporal-spectral resolved microscopy, allowing for the simultaneous imaging of 9 different proteins in live cells and the correlation of multiple activities to cell cycles. Furthermore, tr-FPs enable multiplexing super-resolution microscopy that concurrently visualizes 4 proteins using the lifetime signal and are demonstrated to quantify the stoichiometry of cellular proteins. Our work introduces the concept and development of tr-FPs as a transformative toolset, presenting opportunities to integrate system complexity and quantitative accuracy into biological research.

10.1152/japplphysiol.01354.2007	Resistance training induces qualitative changes in muscle morphology, muscle architecture, and muscle function in elderly postoperative patients.	Suetta C; Andersen JL; Dalgas U; Berget J; Koskinen S; Aagaard P; Magnusson SP; Kjaer M	Although the negative effects of bed rest on muscle strength and muscle mass are well established, it still remains a challenge to identify effective methods to restore physical capacity of elderly patients recovering from hospitalization. The present study compared different training regimes with respect to muscle strength, muscle fiber size, muscle architecture, and stair walking power in elderly postoperative patients. Thirty-six patients (60-86 yr) scheduled for unilateral hip replacement surgery due to hip osteoarthritis were randomized to either 1) resistance training (RT: 3/wk x 12 wk), 2) electrical stimulation (ES: 1 h/day x 12 wk), or 3) standard rehabilitation (SR: 1 h/day x 12 wk). All measurements were performed at baseline, at 5 wk and 12 wk postsurgery. After 12 wk of resistance training, maximal dynamic muscle strength increased by 30% at 60 degrees /s (P &lt; 0.05) and by 29% at 180 degrees /s (P &lt; 0.05); muscle fiber area increased for type I (+17%, P &lt; 0.05), type IIa (+37%, P &lt; 0.05), and type IIx muscle fibers (+51%, P &lt; 0.05); and muscle fiber pennation angle increased by 22% and muscle thickness increased by 15% (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, stair walking power increased by 35% (P &lt; 0.05) and was related to the increase in type II fiber area (r = 0.729, P &lt; 0.05). In contrast, there was no increase in any measurement outcomes with electrical stimulation and standard rehabilitation. The present study is the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of resistance training to induce beneficial qualitative changes in muscle fiber morphology and muscle architecture in elderly postoperative patients. In contrast, rehabilitation regimes based on functional exercises and neuromuscular electrical stimulation had no effect. The present data emphasize the importance of resistance training in future rehabilitation programs for elderly individuals.	J Appl Physiol (1985)	01/07/2008

In the phase 1b TRIMM-2 study, patients with RRMM (at least 3 prior lines of therapy or double refractory to a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory drug) received subcutaneous talquetamab 0.4 mg/kg weekly (QW; &quot;QW cohort&quot;) or 0.8 mg/kg every other week (Q2W; &quot;Q2W cohort&quot;) plus daratumumab 1800 mg per the approved schedule. The primary end point was safety. Secondary end points included overall response and duration of response. Progression-free survival was an exploratory end point. Sixty-five patients (median 5 prior lines of therapy; 61.5% triple-class refractory; 24.6% bispecific antibody-exposed) received talquetamab plus daratumumab (QW, n = 14; Q2W, n = 51; median follow-up: 18.6 months). Most common adverse events were oral events, skin events, cytokine release syndrome, and infections. Grade 3/4 events occurred in 81.5%. Two patients had dose-limiting toxicities, both in the Q2W cohort (grade 3 stomatitis/oral mucositis and grade 3 maculopapular rash). Responses occurred in 71.4% (QW cohort) and 82.4% (Q2W cohort) of patients. Median progression-free survival was 23.3 and 21.2 months, respectively, in each cohort. Pharmacodynamic results suggest the immunomodulatory action of daratumumab contributes to a conducive environment for talquetamab by reducing immunosuppressive cells. Talquetamab plus daratumumab demonstrated promising efficacy outcomes in heavily pretreated patients, with a safety profile consistent with each agent as monotherapy.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the PD-1 inhibitor retifanlimab plus platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment for non-squamous or squamous metastatic NSCLC. METHODS: POD1UM-304 was a phase 3, multiregional, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised study conducted in approximately 124 hospitals and private clinical centres in 16 countries. Male and female adults aged 18 years or older with squamous or non-squamous stage IV NSCLC (staging by American Joint Committee on Cancer version 8) with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1 and no previous systemic therapy for metastatic NSCLC were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) using interactive response technology to receive intravenous retifanlimab 375 mg or matching placebo on day 1 of each 21-day cycle plus standard platinum-based chemotherapy according to tumour histology for up to 2 years. Patients with non-squamous NSCLC received pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) plus cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 for four cycles, or carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 5 on day 1 for four cycles, followed by pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) on day 1 of each subsequent 21-day cycle, all administered intravenously, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with squamous NSCLC received intravenous carboplatin AUC 6 plus intravenous paclitaxel 200 mg/m(2) on day 1 for four cycles or intravenous nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 for four cycles. Treatment with retifanlimab or placebo was given for up to 35 cycles, unless there was disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Randomisation was stratified by PD-L1 expression tumour proportion score, geographical region, and predominant tumour histology. The primary endpoint was overall survival, defined as time from randomisation until death due to any cause, analysed in the full analysis set. Safety was evaluated in all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04205812) and is active but no longer enrolling. FINDINGS: Between Sept 11, 2020, and March 14, 2023, 1388 patients were assessed for eligibility, 583 of whom were randomly assigned to retifanlimab plus chemotherapy (n=391) or placebo plus chemotherapy (n=192). 381 (65%) patients had non-squamous NSCLC and 202 (35%) had squamous NSCLC; 467 (80%) patients were male and 116 (20%) were female. Median age was 64 years (IQR 58-68). Median overall survival was longer in the retifanlimab plus chemotherapy group than in the placebo plus chemotherapy group (18·1 months [95% CI 16·2-21·0] vs 13·4 months [11·0-16·7]; hazard ratio 0·75 [95% CI 0·60-0·93]; p=0·0042). Overall, higher incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events that were serious (158 [41%] of 389 vs 57 [30%] of 190), grade 3 or worse (238 [61%] vs 103 [54%]), or led to retifanlimab or placebo dose delay (169 [43%] vs 67 [35%]) or discontinuation (33 [8%] vs nine [5%]) were observed in the retifanlimab plus chemotherapy group than in the placebo plus chemotherapy group. The proportions of fatal COVID-19-related treatment-emergent adverse events were similar in the retifanlimab plus chemotherapy group and the placebo plus chemotherapy group (four [1%] vs five [3%]). INTERPRETATION: Retifanlimab improved overall survival compared with placebo when added to platinum-based chemotherapy, with a safety profile that is representative of previous PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitor-chemotherapy combinations. Adding retifanlimab to first-line chemotherapy could be a potential treatment option for patients with squamous or non-squamous metastatic NSCLC. FUNDING: Incyte.	Lancet Respir Med	19/09/2025
10.4239/wjd.v16.i9.109123	Saving muscle while losing weight: A vital strategy for sustainable results while on glucagon-like peptide-1 related drugs.	Cigrovski Berkovic M; Ruzic L; Cigrovski V; Strollo F	Obesity affects over 1 billion people worldwide and is linked to more than 230 health complications, with cardiovascular disease being a leading cause of mortality. Losing 5%-10% of body weight is considered clinically significant for improving health. This weight loss can be achieved through pharmacotherapy, including glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide dual receptor agonists, and GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide/glucagon triple receptor agonists (such as semaglutide, tirzepatide, and retatrutide, respectively). While much of the weight loss comes from fat mass, these treatments also result in the loss of lean mass, including muscle. This loss of muscle may contribute to difficulties in maintaining weight over the long term and can lead to sarcopenia. Therefore, the focus of new anti-obesity treatments should be primarily on reducing fat mass while minimizing the loss of muscle mass, ideally promoting muscle gain. Research focusing on human myocytes has identified more than 600 myokines associated with muscle contraction, which may play a crucial role in preserving both muscle mass and function. We explored the potential of new anti-obesity agents and their combinations with incretin-based therapies to achieve these outcomes. Further studies are needed to better understand the functional implications of lean mass expansion during weight loss and weight maintenance programs.	World J Diabetes	15/09/2025
10.1038/s41467-025-62419-0	Shared genetic architecture contributes to risk of major cardiovascular diseases.	Qiao J; Jiang L; Cai L; Chang M; Wang C; Zhao R; Song S; Zhao Y; Chen M; Ding S; Tan N; He P; Sadayappan S; Xu J; Pauklin S; Liu Z; Feng Y	The extensive co-occurrence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), as evidenced by epidemiological studies, is supported by positive genetic correlations identified in comprehensive genetic investigations, suggesting a shared genetic basis. However, the precise genetic mechanisms underlying these associations remain elusive. By assessing genetic correlations, genetic overlap, and causal connections, we aim to shed light on common genetic underpinnings among major CVDs. Employing multi-trait analysis, we pursue diverse strategies to unveil shared genetic elements, encompassing SNPs, genes, gene sets, and functional categories with pleiotropic implications. Our study systematically quantifies genetic overlap beyond genome-wide genetic correlations across CVDs, while identifying a putative causal relationship between coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure (HF). We then pinpointed 38 genomic loci with pleiotropic influence across CVDs, of which the most influential pleiotropic locus is located at the LPA gene. Notably, 12 loci present high evidence of multi-trait colocalization and display congruent directional effects. Examination of genes and gene sets linked to these loci unveiled robust associations with circulatory system development processes. Intriguingly, distinct patterns predominantly driven by atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and venous thromboembolism underscore the significant disparities between clinically defined CVD classifications and underlying shared biological mechanisms, according to functional annotation findings.

10.1038/s42255-025-01371-1	Mapping the plasma metabolome to human health and disease in 274,241 adults.	You J; Cui XH; Chen YL; Wang YX; Li HY; Qiang YX; Cheng JY; Deng YT; Guo Y; Ren P; Zhang Y; He Y; He XY; Chen SD; Zhang YR; Huang YY; Mao Y; Feng JF; Cheng W; Yu JT	A systematic characterization of metabolic profiles in human health and disease enhances precision medicine. Here we present a comprehensive human metabolome-phenome atlas, using data from 274,241 UK Biobank participants with nuclear magnetic resonance metabolic measures. This atlas links 313 plasma metabolites to 1,386 diseases and 3,142 traits, with participants being prospectively followed for a median of 14.9 years. This atlas uncovered 52,836 metabolite-disease and 73,639 metabolite-trait associations, where the ratio of cholesterol to total lipids in large low-density lipoprotein percentage was found as the metabolite associated with the highest number (n = 526) of diseases. In addition, we found that more than half (57.5%) of metabolites showed statistical variations from healthy individuals over a decade before disease onset. Combined with demographics, the machine-learning-based metabolic risk score signified the top 30 (around 10%) metabolites as biomarkers, yielding favourable classification performance (area under the curve &gt; 0.8) for 94 prevalent and 81 incident diseases. Finally, Mendelian randomization analyses provided support for causal relationships of 454 metabolite-disease pairs, among which 402 exhibited shared genetic determinants. Additional insights can be gleaned via an accessible interactive resource ( https://metabolome-phenome-atlas.com/ ).	Nat Metab	19/09/2025
10.1093/jnci/djaf201	Adiposity distribution and risks of 12 obesity-related cancers: a Mendelian randomization analysis.	Hazelwood E; Goudswaard LJ; Lee MA; Vabistsevits M; Pournaras DJ; Brenner H; Buchanan DD; Gruber SB; Gsur A; Li L; Vodickova L; Grant RC; Samadder NJ; Timpson NJ; Gunter MJ; Schuster-Böckler B; Yarmolinsky J; Richardson TG; Freisling H; Murphy N; Vincent EE	INTRODUCTION: There is convincing evidence that overall adiposity increases the risks of several cancers. Whether the distribution of adiposity plays a similar role is unclear. METHODS: We used 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to examine causal relationships of 5 adiposity distribution traits (abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (ASAT); visceral adipose tissue (VAT); gluteofemoral adipose tissue (GFAT); liver fat; and pancreas fat) with the risks of 12 obesity-related cancers (endometrial, ovarian, breast, colorectal, pancreas, multiple myeloma, liver, kidney (renal cell), thyroid, gallbladder, esophageal adenocarcinoma, and meningioma). RESULTS: Sample size across all genome-wide association studies (GWAS) ranged from 8407 to 728 896 (median: 57 249). We found evidence that higher genetically predicted ASAT increased the risks of endometrial cancer, liver cancer, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) per standard deviation (SD) higher ASAT = 1.79 (1.18 to 2.71), 3.83 (1.39 to 10.53), and 2.34 (1.15 to 4.78), respectively). Conversely, we found evidence that higher genetically predicted GFAT decreased the risks of breast cancer and meningioma (ORs and 95% CIs per SD higher genetically predicted GFAT = 0.77 (0.62 to 0.97) and 0.53 (0.32 to 0.90), respectively). We also found evidence for an effect of higher genetically predicted VAT and liver fat on increased liver cancer risk (ORs and 95% CIs per SD higher genetically predicted adiposity trait = 4.29 (1.41 to 13.07) and 4.09 (2.29 to 7.28), respectively). DISCUSSION: Our analyses provide novel insights into the relationship between adiposity distribution and cancer risk. These insights highlight the potential importance of adipose tissue distribution alongside maintaining a healthy weight for cancer prevention.	J Natl Cancer Inst	24/09/2025
10.1093/nar/gkaf875	DNA polymerase kappa is the primary translesion synthesis polymerase for aldehyde ICLs.	van der Sluijs RV; Verkennis AEE; Hodskinson MR; Barnett J; Cruz VM; Hernandez-Quiles M; Liolios T; Morton SB; Hendrikx A; Bos C; Post H; Millington CL; Rouillon C; Ricci G; Mattiroli F; Williams DM; Altelaar M; Vermeulen M; Patel KJ; Knipscheer P	DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are highly cytotoxic lesions that block essential cellular processes like replication and transcription. Endogenous ICLs can be induced by reactive aldehydes produced during normal cellular metabolism. Defective repair of these aldehyde-induced ICLs is associated with Fanconi anaemia (FA), a cancer predisposition syndrome. We previously showed that acetaldehyde-induced ICLs are repaired by the FA pathway and a novel excision-independent pathway. Here, we demonstrate that ICLs induced by acrolein, another cellular aldehyde, are also repaired by both pathways, establishing the generality of aldehyde ICL repair. Focusing on the FA pathway, we identify DNA polymerase kappa (Polκ) as the primary translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerase responsible for the insertion step during lesion bypass of unhooked aldehyde ICLs. This function requires Polκ&#x27;s catalytic activity and PCNA interaction domains but is independent of Rev1 interaction. In contrast, Polκ has a non-catalytic role in the extension step of cisplatin ICL repair that is dependent on Rev1 interaction. Our work reveals a key role for Polκ in aldehyde ICL repair and provides mechanistic insights into how different ICL structures determine the choice of TLS polymerases during repair.

10.1111/apa.14614	Follow-up study of the early, randomised paracetamol trial to preterm infants, found no adverse reactions at the two-years corrected age.	Juujärvi S; Kallankari H; Pätsi P; Leskinen M; Saarela T; Hallman M; Aikio O	AIM: We examined the long-term outcomes and safety of early intravenous paracetamol for ductus arteriosus closure at a corrected age of two years. METHODS: This was a follow-up of the 2013-2014 randomised, double-blind Preterm Infant&#x27;s Paracetamol Study at Oulu University Hospital, Finland, which recruited 48 very preterm infants within 24 hours of birth. They received intravenous paracetamol or a placebo for four days. In 2015-2017, we followed up 44 infants (92%) at two years of corrected age. This included clinical and neurodevelopmental assessments and a parental medical history questionnaire. RESULTS: The 44 infants (55% boys) were born at 23(5) -31(6) weeks of gestation. No differences in the cardiac parameters, including blood pressures and ultrasound scan results, were found. Neurodevelopmental stages, as quantified by the Griffiths test, were similar. No signs of autism were reported. Asthma medication was more common in the control group, but the difference was not significant. Atopy scores, numbers of infections and the use of public health services were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSION: No long-term adverse reactions of early intravenous paracetamol were detected two years later. Larger trials are needed on the safety and efficacy of paracetamol prophylaxis for early ductal closure in very preterm infants.	Acta Paediatr	01/03/2019
10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2025.105216	Nursing judgment in the age of generative artificial intelligence: A cross-national study on clinical decision-making performance among emergency nurses.	Levin C; Zaboli A; Turcato G; Saban M	BACKGROUND: Clinical decision-making is a core competency in emergency nursing, requiring rapid and accurate assessments. With the growing integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, there is a pressing need to understand its potential as a clinical decision support tool. While Generative Artificial Intelligence models show high accuracy and consistency, their ability to navigate complex, context-sensitive scenarios remains in question. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the clinical decision-making performance of emergency nurses from Israel and Italy with Generative Artificial Intelligence models (Claude-3.5, ChatGPT-4.0, and Gemini-1.5). It evaluated differences in severity assessment, hospitalization decisions, and test selection, while exploring the influence of demographic and professional characteristics on decision accuracy. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted among 82 emergency nurses (49 from Italy, 33 from Israel), each independently evaluating five standardized clinical cases. Their decisions were compared with those generated by Generative Artificial Intelligence models using a structured evaluation rubric. Statistical analyses included ANOVA, chi-square tests, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to assess predictive accuracy. RESULTS: Generative Artificial Intelligence models exhibited higher overall decision accuracy and stronger alignment with expert recommendations. However, notable discrepancies emerged in hospitalization decisions and severity assessments. For example, in Case 2, Generative Artificial Intelligence rated severity as level 1, while Italian and Israeli nurses rated it at 1.98 and 2.23, respectively (P &lt; 0.01, F = 199). In Case 1, only 4.1 % of Italian nurses recommended hospitalization compared to 30.3 % of Israeli nurses, whereas all Generative Artificial Intelligence models advised hospitalization. Nurses showed greater variability in test selection and severity judgments, reflecting their use of clinical intuition and contextual reasoning. Demographics such as age, gender, and years of experience did not significantly predict accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Generative Artificial Intelligence models demonstrated consistency and expert alignment but lacked the contextual sensitivity vital in emergency care. These results highlight the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence as a clinical decision-support tool while emphasizing the continued importance of human clinical judgment.

10.1038/s41564-025-02107-3	Oxaloacetate sensing promotes innate immune antiviral defence against influenza virus infection.	Jin S; He X; Wang Z; Zhou T; Wang J; Pan G; Zhang Y; Ma L; Yang S; Wang L; Wu Y; Zou Y; Qi N; Cui J	Metabolic pathways determine cellular fate and function; however, the exact roles of metabolites in host defence against influenza virus remain undefined. Here we employed pharmacological inhibition and metabolomics analysis to show that the metabolic pathways of oxaloacetate (OAA) are integrated with antiviral responses to influenza virus. Cytosolic malate dehydrogenase 1 senses intracellular OAA to undergo dimerization and functions as a scaffold to recruit the transcription factor ETS2 for phosphorylation by the kinase TAOK1 at serine 313. The phosphorylated ETS2 translocates into the nucleus and supports optimal expression of TBK1, an indispensable activator of type I interferon responses. OAA supplementation provides a broad-spectrum antiviral ability, and OAA deficiency caused by Acly genetic ablation decreases antiviral immunity and renders mice more susceptible to lethal H1N1 virus infection. Our results uncover a signalling pathway through cellular OAA sensing that links metabolism and innate immunity to coordinate defence against viral challenge.	Nat Microbiol	22/09/2025
10.4274/dir.2025.253249	Imaging in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: review of the current literature.	Hekimoglu K; Gopalan D; Onur MR; Kahraman G; Akay T	Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a severe, life-threatening complication of pulmonary embolism with pulmonary hypertension (PH). The combination of insufficient resolution of thrombi following pulmonary emboli and accompanying microvascular disease results in PH. Advances in imaging can offer better insight into CTEPH diagnosis and management, but lack of disease awareness among radiologists has been shown to be a cause of CTEPH misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis. This review highlights features pertinent to CTEPH diagnosis. The primary focus is on different modalities with their distinctive signs and newly developed technologies employing artificial intelligence systems.	Diagn Interv Radiol	23/09/2025

We provide updated global estimates of prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs) from 1990 to 2021 across 204 countries and territories and forecasts through 2050. In 2021, there are 2.0 billion people with TTH and 1.2 billion with migraine. Although TTH is more prevalent, migraine causes higher disability. While crude prevalence and YLDs increased, age-standardized rates remained stable and are projected to continue this trend due to population growth. There is a disproportionately higher burden in women aged 30-44 and countries with higher Socio-demographic Index and Healthcare Access and Quality Index. Despite this, migraines remain underrecognized in health policies and funding. This study emphasizes the urgent need to prioritize headache disorders in global health agendas.

10.1002/advs.202504088	Single-Cell Transcriptomics Reveals ITGA2-Mediated Metabolic Reprogramming and Immune Crosstalk in Pediatric Thyroid Carcinogenesis.	Zhan ZJ; Li N; Sun Y; Chen L; Yin JD; Shan YH; Zeng JX; Li ZC; Tan HL; Tang N; Chang S; Huang P	Pediatric papillary thyroid carcinoma (PPTC) has exhibited a progressive increase in incidence in recent years, characterized by heightened biological aggressiveness relative to adult papillary thyroid carcinoma (APTC). Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms governing PPTC-specific pathobiology remain elusive. Through high-resolution single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of 90234 cellular transcriptomes from 4 PPTC and 9 APTC clinical specimens, a phenotypically distinct cellular subpopulation (ITGA2(hi)-PTC cells) mechanistically responsible for PPTC&#x27;s distinct clinical behavior, is identified. By integrating PPTC-derived organoid models with in vivo functional validation and multiplex immunohistochemistry, it is demonstrated that ITGA2 orchestrates dual oncogenic pathways: 1) augmentation of glycolytic flux and 2) induction of M2 macrophage polarization. These synergistic mechanisms fundamentally drive PPTC oncogenesis and metastatic progression. Cross-validation across independent clinical cohorts consistently confirms the translational significance of these findings. Our multi-omics characterization of PPTC-specific cellular ecosystems and signaling cascades establishes a mechanistic framework for advancing diagnostic precision and targeted therapeutic development.

10.1097/JS9.0000000000003525	Simultaneous Assessment of Stress Hyperglycemia Ratio and Glucose Variability to Predict All-cause Mortality in Sepsis Patients Across Different Glucose Metabolic States: an Observational Cohort Study With Interpretable Machine Learning Approach.	Wang F; Guo Y; Jiao C; Zhao S; Sui L; Mao Z; Lu R; Hou R; Zhu X	BACKGROUND: Stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) and glycemic variability (GV) reflect acute glucose elevation and fluctuation, which are associated with adverse outcomes in patients with some diseases. However, the relationship between combined assessment of SHR and GV and mortality risk in sepsis remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the associations of SHR, GV, and their combination with sepsis mortality among individuals with different glucose metabolic states, and to develop a mortality prediction model using machine learning (ML) models. METHODS: Patients with sepsis were screened in the MIMIC-IV database, stratified into normal glucose regulation (NGR), pre-diabetes mellitus(Pre-DM), and diabetes mellitus(DM) groups based on glucose metabolic status. Associations with mortality were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier(KM) curves, Cox proportional hazards model, restricted cubic splines(RCS), and landmark analyses. Five ML algorithms were employed for prediction, with SHapley Additive explanations (SHAP) interpreting key predictors. RESULTS: A total of 4,838 patients were enrolled, with a median age of 68 years. Overall, 641 patients (13.2%) died in the ICU, and 936 patients (19.3%) died within 28 days after admission to the ICU. In NGR patients, combined high SHR (&gt;1.23; highest tertile) and high GV (&gt;28.56; highest tertile)-determined based on tertile distribution-conferred the highest 28-day mortality risk (HR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.40-3.04). Pre-DM patients with low SHR/high GV (SHR&lt;1.23, GV&gt;28.56) showed the greatest 28-day mortality risk (HR = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.73-3.48). DM patients with high SHR/low GV (SHR&gt;1.23, GV&lt;28.56) had the highest 28-day mortality risk (HR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.06-2.01). Machine learning models-particularly XGBoost (AUC: 0.746), Random Forest (AUC: 0.776), and Logistic Regression (AUC: 0.776)-demonstrated the strongest predictive performance for these endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: The combined assessment of SHR and GV may provide useful information for predicting mortality in sepsis patients-particularly among individuals with NGR and Pre-DM. This integrated approach highlights the potential need for personalized glycemic management strategies, which warrants further investigation in prospective studies.	Int J Surg	24/09/2025
10.1097/HEP.0000000000001523	FXR splicing by SF3B3 promotes MYC-driven hepatocarcinogenesis.	Wang X; Luo J; Han L; Xu T; Wang H; Zhang M; Li G; Li X; Zhang W; Zhang Y	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dysregulation of the MYC oncogene is a major genetic event in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a bile acid (BA) receptor, has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for various liver diseases. Both BA composition and FXR isoforms have been shown to be significantly altered in human HCCs. This study aimed to investigate their potential roles in MYC-driven hepatocarcinogenesis. APPROACH AND RESULTS: HCC was induced in mice by hydrodynamic injection with MYC and MCL1 oncogenes. UPLC-MS/MS analysis revealed elevated BA levels, particularly primary conjugated BAs, in both serum and livers of MYC-driven HCC mice. qPCR and western blot analyses demonstrated suppression of BSEP and dysregulation of FXR splicing in the livers of these mice. Using RNA antisense purification coupled with mass spectrometry (RAP-MS), the splicing factor SF3B3 was identified as a regulator of FXR splicing. Both in silico and in vitro studies confirmed that SF3B3 is a direct downstream target of MYC in mice and humans. Functionally, overexpression of Fxrα2 and Fxrα4 or deletion of Sf3b3 significantly impeded MYC-driven hepatocarcinogenesis in mice. Moreover, combination treatment with a SF3B inhibitor and an FXR agonist synergistically suppressed proliferation of HCC cells. Analysis of clinical HCC samples revealed a positive correlation between SF3B3 and the relative expression of FXRα2. CONCLUSIONS: SF3B3 is a key downstream effector of MYC-driven hepatocarcinogenesis and a critical regulator of FXR splicing. Both SF3B3 and FXR represent druggable vulnerabilities in MYC-amplified HCC.	Hepatology	23/09/2025

However, the involvement of N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) RNA modifications in this process remains elusive. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and m(6)A RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) across multiple time points postinjury revealed a strong correlation between m(6)A modifications and genes enriched in microglia/macrophages. Furthermore, the m(6)A demethylase ALKBH5 was identified as a key regulator of dynamic m(6)A patterns at the injury site. ALKBH5 suppression in microglia/macrophages exacerbated neuroinflammation in vitro and worsened neurological deficits in controlled cortical impact (CCI) models. MeRIP-qPCR and RNA pull-down assays revealed SOCS3 was a downstream target of ALKBH5-mediated m(6)A demethylation. This demethylation stabilized Socs3 mRNA and enhanced its protein expression, which in turn suppressed neuroinflammation via inhibiting the JAK2-STAT3 pathway. Conversely, SOCS3 depletion impaired functional recovery after injury.

10.1136/bmj-2025-084062	Risk prediction models for cancer therapy related cardiac dysfunction in patients with cancer and cancer survivors: systematic review and meta-analysis.	Gomes C; Geels J; Debray TPA; Malekzadeh A; Asselbergs FW; Linschoten M	OBJECTIVES: To systematically review all prediction models developed or validated for cancer therapy related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) and to quantitatively analyse their performance. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Embase, Medline, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, from inception to 23 August 2024. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Studies that developed or externally validated multivariable models to predict CTRCD risk in young people (children, adolescents, and young adults (≤39 years)) or older adults (≥40 years) with cancer or cancer survivors treated with systemic antineoplastic agents. Studies on radiation induced cardiotoxicity were excluded. METHODS: Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool. Performance measures were pooled using random effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: 56 studies were included, reporting 51 developed models and 12 externally validated models. Most models were developed in adults (n=34/51, 67%), primarily for breast cancer (n=20/34, 59%) or haematological malignancies (n=6/34, 18%) to determine pretreatment risk (n=33/34, 97%). In young people, most developed models (n=16/17, 94%) focused on long term risk assessment, mostly in survivors of haematological malignancies. Discrimination and calibration metrics were reported for 13/51 (25%) developed models and 6/44 (14%) external validations. Nearly all models were at high risk of bias. 12/51 (24%) developed models underwent external validation, four of 17 (24%) in young people and eight of 34 (24%) in adult populations. The Heart Failure Association-International Cardio-Oncology Society (HFA-ICOS) tool was the most frequently validated (11 times), mainly in patients with breast cancer receiving HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) targeted therapies (5/11, 45%). Across all external validations, this tool consistently underestimated risk, with observed event rates exceeding predicted risks, especially in studies where mild CTRCD was the most frequently reported outcome. Among patients with breast cancer treated with anti-HER2 agents, the pooled C statistic was 0.60 (95% confidence interval 0.52 to 0.68). In this population, observed pooled event rates were 12% in the low risk group (&lt;2% predicted), 15% in the medium risk group (2-9%), 25% in the high risk group (10-19%), and 41% in the very high risk group (≥20%). CONCLUSIONS: Existing prediction models for CTRCD need additional evidence before widespread clinical adoption. Poor reporting of key performance metrics and limited external validation studies currently restrict their thorough evaluation. The HFA-ICOS tool shows suboptimal performance, especially when mild forms of CTRCD are included as events. Future research should prioritise validating and updating existing models using large, clustered datasets across various malignancies to enhance the assessment of their performance, generalisability, and clinical utility in routine practice.

10.1172/jci.insight.193038	Th17 cells with regulatory phenotype are the main IL-17F and IL-26 producers in palmoplantar pustulosis.	Do TH; Bogle R; Zhang H; Xing X; Gharaee-Kermani M; Raducu M; Fox J; Jiang R; Plazyo O; Harms PW; Nakamura M; Xing E; Gilliet M; Billi AC; Kahlenberg JM; Modlin RL; Uluckan O; Tsoi LC; Gudjonsson JE	Palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder marked by erythematous pustules and desquamation on the palms and soles. While IL-17 pathways are implicated in PPP, IL-17 blockers have shown modest efficacy, underscoring the need for a deeper understanding of IL-17 involvement. To dissect the cellular and spatial architecture of PPP, we performed single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) on lesional, nonlesional, and healthy acral skin to examine cellular composition, transcriptomic profiles, and cell-cell interactions. Unbiased clustering revealed 9 major cell types, including an inflammatory keratinocyte subset enriched in IL-17A/TNF signatures and marked by high IL-36G expression. Within the lymphocyte compartment, we identified a hybrid &quot;regTh17&quot; population coexpressing regulatory markers (FOXP3, CTLA4, TIGIT), IL17F, and IL26. This regTh17 subset was distinguished by elevated IL1R1 and CD39, suggesting an IL-1β-driven differentiation. Spatial analyses demonstrated significant neighborhood enrichment of regTh17 cells with IL-36G+ supraspinous keratinocytes. RegTh17 cells were the predominant source of IL-17F and IL-26 signals, whereas keratinocytes were predicted as their main receivers. We further observed regTh17 coexpressing TNFRSF4 (OX40) and TNFRSF18 (GITR) specifically at sites of IL36G+ keratinocyte interactions, implicating these pathways in amplification of the IL-17/IL-36 inflammatory loop. Together, our integrated single-cell and spatial profiling uncovers Th17 plasticity in PPP, identifies a regTh17-keratinocyte interaction, and highlights IL-17F, IL-26, OX40/OX40L, and GITR/GITRL as candidate targets for precision therapies in this challenging disease.

10.1186/s12902-025-02025-9	Soluble receptor for advanced glycation end product (sRAGE) levels in adolescents with obesity, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome: A case-control study and the review of the literature.	Ustkoyuncu PS; Kocer D	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate sRAGE levels in adolescents with obesity, and to determine the relationship between sRAGE, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome in a case-control study. METHODS: Thirty adolescents with insulin resistance, 28 adolescents without insulin resistance between 10 and 18 years old and 30 Healthy gender and age matched control group were included in the study. Patients with a body mass index z-score above 2, comprised the obesity group. HOMA-IR value above 3.16 was accepted as insulin resistance. Metabolic syndrome was defined based on the International Diabetes Federation definition. RESULTS: sRAGE levels of the both groups with obesity were lower than control and they were negative correlated with weight, body mass index, C-reactive protein, uric acid, diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference, waist circumference/height ratio and white blood cell count. There were no significant differences in sRAGE levels between adolescents with or without metabolic syndrome, nor between boys and girls. Also, there were no significant differences in sRAGE levels between with or without insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: sRAGE levels of the adolescents with obesity decreased. There was no difference in sRAGE levels between those with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome compared to those without. Metabolic complications associated with obesity are important in terms of causing mortality and morbidity. Understanding the mechanisms could help to identify therapeutic strategies.

10.1093/eurjpc/zwaf598	Variations in remnant cholesterol and the risk of cardiovascular disease: a national longitudinal cohort study.	Zhu X; Xu W; Hao B; Chen Q; Xiong Z; Wang Q; Hou X; Chen Y; Guo J; Chen T	AIM: Remnant cholesterol (RC) has been recognized as a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the association between long-term changes in RC during follow-up and incident CVD remains underexplored, with most research focusing on baseline RC levels. METHODS: Data for this prospective cohort study were derived from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). RC levels were calculated using the Friedewald equation. Changes in RC, cumulative RC, and the change in RC (ΔRC) were assessed by comparing RC levels at Waves 1 and 3. Cox proportional hazard models, adjusted for potential confounders, were used to evaluate the impact of baseline and dynamic RC levels on incident CVD risk. RESULTS: Among 3,866 participants (46.23% male, mean age: 57.50 years) followed for 5.0 years, participants with initially high RC who decreased to low levels showed reduced CVD risk (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54-0.94). Those with low baseline RC escalating to high levels showed similar risk (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.68-1.06) compared to consistently high RC levels. Highest tertile cumulative RC significantly increased CVD risk (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.11-1.69). Among high baseline RC participants, those in the lowest ΔRC tertile had reduced CVD risk (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52-0.89). CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal RC increases were associated with higher CVD risks, while RC reductions were associated with decreased risks. RC monitoring and management may contribute to CVD risk assessment and prevention, though further research with direct RC measurement and clinically validated outcomes is needed.

10.1002/advs.202503897	Histone Lactylation-Driven Upregulation of VRK1 Expression Promotes Stemness and Proliferation of Glioma Stem Cells.	Li J; Tang C; Zhang X; Xing R; Guo Q	Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant primary brain tumor in adults, with glioma stem cells (GSCs) as a subpopulation contributing to treatment resistance and recurrence. This study investigates the role of lactate and its regulatory gene, vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1), in the regulation of GSC stemness. Utilizing multiple glioma-related databases and patient-derived GSCs, it is discovered that lactate enhances the stemness and proliferation of GSCs via VRK1. Mechanistically, lactate promotes histone lactylation (H3K18la) at the VRK1 promoter in GSCs, thereby upregulating VRK1 expression. VRK1 enhances Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) protein stability by inhibiting its ubiquitination and degradation, and phosphorylates YBX1 to promote its nuclear translocation, thereby regulating GSC stemness and proliferation via the YBX1/SOX2 pathway. Additionally, the VRK1-targeted nanoliposome A/TMZ-siVRK1 effectively suppresses the stemness and proliferation of GSCs, demonstrating its therapeutic potential. In conclusion, lactate regulates the stemness and proliferation of GSCs via the H3K18la/VRK1/YBX1/SOX2 pathway. This study elucidates the role of histone lactylation in stem cell regulation and suggests that VRK1 is a potential therapeutic target for GBM.	Adv Sci (Weinh)	24/09/2025
10.1038/s41413-025-00455-8	Research progress on sarcopenia in the musculoskeletal system.	Mao X; Lv K; Qi W; Cheng W; Li T; Sun Y; Jin H; Pan H; Wang D	Sarcopenia, a progressive and systemic skeletal muscle disorder marked by the accelerated deterioration of both muscle function and mass, is highly prevalent among the elderly population, significantly contributing to an elevated risk of adverse outcomes, including falls, fractures, and muscle weakness. Clinical investigations have identified a strong correlation between sarcopenia and several prevalent degenerative skeletal muscle disorders. This correlation is attributed to imbalances in joint mechanics resulting from localized muscle atrophy and the influence of musculoskeletal secretory factors. In this review, we discuss the broader implications of sarcopenia and critically evaluate the currently established assessment methods. Furthermore, the clinical significance of prevalent musculoskeletal disorders (including osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and spinal pathologies) in relation to sarcopenia, alongside the underlying mechanisms influencing this relationship, is summarized. Additionally, the effects of sarcopenia on the therapeutic efficacy of medications and surgical interventions for musculoskeletal conditions are reviewed. Sarcopenia is intricately linked to the onset, progression, and prognosis of musculoskeletal disorders. Future research should prioritize elucidating the potential mechanisms that connect muscle loss with skeletal muscle diseases, and investigating whether mitigating sarcopenia symptoms could decelerate the progression of these disorders, thereby paving new pathways for therapeutic interventions.

10.1038/s41582-025-01136-0	Progress and challenges in sporadic late-onset cerebellar ataxias.	Wirth T; Faber J; Depienne C; Roze E; Honnorat J; Meissner WG; Giunti P; Tranchant C; Klockgether T; Anheim M	Sporadic late-onset cerebellar ataxia (SLOCA) is a syndrome defined by subacute or chronic and progressive ataxia occurring after the age of 40 years in individuals without a family history of ataxia. The 2022 publication of revised consensus diagnostic criteria for multiple system atrophy and the emergence of promising biomarkers provides a thorough diagnostic framework that now enables the diagnosis of numerous acquired causes of SLOCA, including autoimmune disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. The ongoing development and increased availability of DNA sequencing technology have uncovered several molecular causes of SLOCA besides spastic paraplegia type 7 and very late-onset Friedreich ataxia. These additional causes include sporadic genetic disorders, such as spinocerebellar atrophy type 27B, caused by GAA expansion in the FGF14 gene, and cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), caused by biallelic expansions in the RFC1 gene. This Review presents an updated clinical approach to the diagnosis and management of SLOCA that focuses on the most important developments in this field. Future challenges are also discussed, including the identification of additional missing genetic causes of SLOCA, especially via the use of long-read genome sequencing, improvements in SLOCA prognostication and the implementation of clinical trials of neuroprotective interventions.

Through genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we identified the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) valosin-containing protein (VCP) as a critical dependency in CCA. Compound screens revealed that the VCP inhibitor CB-5339 potently suppresses CCA proliferation in a panel of patient-derived organoids by inducing cellular senescence. It is known that senescent cells persist, and this can contribute to therapy resistance. To address this, we combined CB-5339 with senolytic agents (ABT-263 and conatumumab), which selectively eliminate senescent CCA cells, resulting in enhanced tumor suppression both in vitro and in vivo. Clinical analysis showed that VCP overexpression in CCA patients correlates with poor prognosis. Our study unveils a &quot;one-two punch&quot; strategy, targeting VCP-mediated senescence followed by senolytic clearance, offering a promising therapeutic approach for CCA.

10.1093/ehjopen/oeaf117	Tirzepatide compared with semaglutide and 10-year cardiovascular disease risk reduction in obesity: post-hoc analysis of the SURMOUNT-5 trial.	Mamas MA; Bays H; Li R; Upadhyay N; Irani T; Senyucel C; Dunn JP; Liu-Seifert H	AIMS: Approximately two-thirds of obesity-related mortality is attributable to cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this analysis is to examine predicted CVD risk reduction following weight loss in persons with obesity for primary prevention between tirzepatide and semaglutide, and projected CVD events that could be potentially prevented in the USA. METHODS AND RESULTS: SURMOUNT-5 was a Phase 3b, open-label, randomized trial conducted in participants with obesity and without Type-2 diabetes, comparing tirzepatide (10 or 15 mg) with semaglutide (1.7 or 2.4 mg) and administered via weekly subcutaneous injection. Predicted 10-year CVD risks were compared between treatments at baseline and up to 72 weeks post-treatment among participants without prior CVD. The impact of cardiovascular risk reduction was estimated as the projected preventable CVD events over 10 years for tirzepatide and semaglutide in the USA. The average predicted 10-year CVD risk score before treatment was 9.3%. Treatment with tirzepatide was associated with significantly greater reduction in predicted 10-year CVD risk compared with semaglutide (absolute reduction from baseline of 2.4% and 1.4%, respectively, P &lt; 0.001). Translating risk reduction to the US population who met treatment eligibility criteria and without prior CVD (∼85 million), an estimated 2 million CVD events could be potentially prevented over 10 years after 72 weeks of tirzepatide treatment, vs. 1.15 million with semaglutide. CONCLUSION: In SURMOUNT-5, treatment with tirzepatide was associated with greater predicted 10-year CVD risk reduction compared with semaglutide. This post hoc analysis suggests tirzepatide treatment may provide greater benefit in primary prevention of CVD than semaglutide in people with obesity and overweight.

Chapters on oncological and oncoplastic-reconstructive surgery are coordinated with the Working Group for Plastic, Aesthetic, and Reconstructive Surgery in Gynecology (AWOgyn). The most important changes include the incorporation of INSEMA and SOUND trial results into the guidelines. In patients with low-risk characteristics, defined as age ≥50 years, postmenopausal status, hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative subtype, tumor grading G1-2 with a maximum preoperative size of 2 cm, and unsuspicious axillary ultrasound and clinical examination, the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) can be omitted if breast-conserving surgery and whole-breast irradiation are planned. In patients with 1-2 macrometastatic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) undergoing a mastectomy and postoperative irradiation, completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is no longer recommended. After neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST), ALND is recommended if the targeted axillary dissection (TAD) shows macrometastases in the sentinel and/or in the target lymph node (the node that was marked and had a macrometastasis in the biopsy before NST). Patients with isolated tumor cells in the sentinel and/or target lymph node should not receive ALND after NST. In case of ypN1mi status, the decision to perform a completion ALND should be made on a case-by-case basis. Oncoplastic surgery is safe and may replace a mastectomy in select cases.

10.1136/bmjebm-2025-113913	Alcohol use and risk of dementia in diverse populations: evidence from cohort, case-control and Mendelian randomisation approaches.	Topiwala A; Levey DF; Zhou H; Deak JD; Adhikari K; Ebmeier KP; Bell S; Burgess S; Nichols TE; Gaziano M; Stein M; Gelernter J	OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between alcohol consumption and dementia. DESIGN: Prospective cohort and case-control analyses combined with linear and non-linear Mendelian randomisation. SETTING: Two large-scale population-based cohorts: the US Million Veteran Programme and the UK Biobank. Genetic analyses used summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). PARTICIPANTS: 559 559 adults aged 56-72 years at baseline were included in observational analyses (mean follow-up: 4 years in the US cohort; 12 years in the UK cohort). Genetic analyses used summary data from multiple large GWAS consortia (2.4 million participants). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident all-cause dementia, determined through health record linkage, and genetic proxies. RESULTS: During follow-up, 14 540 participants developed dementia and 48 034 died. Observational phenotype-only analyses revealed U-shaped associations between alcohol and dementia risk: higher risk was observed among non-drinkers, heavy drinkers (&gt;40 drinks per week; HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.74), and those with alcohol use disorder (AUD) (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.60) compared with light drinkers. In contrast, Mendelian randomisation genetic analysis identified a monotonic increase in dementia risk with greater alcohol consumption. A 1 SD increase in log-transformed drinks per week was associated with a 15% dementia increase (inverse-variance weighted (IVW) OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.27). A twofold increase in AUD prevalence was associated with a 16% increase in dementia risk (IVW OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.30). Alcohol intake increased dementia, but individuals who developed dementia also experienced a decline in alcohol intake over time, suggesting reverse causation-where early cognitive decline leads to reduced alcohol consumption-underlies the supposed protective alcohol effects in observational studies. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide evidence for a relationship between all types of alcohol use and increased dementia risk. While correlational observational data suggested a protective effect of light drinking, this could be in part attributable to reduced drinking seen in early dementia; genetic analyses did not support any protective effect, suggesting that any level of alcohol consumption may contribute to dementia risk. Public health strategies that reduce the prevalence of alcohol use disorder could potentially lower the incidence of dementia by up to 16%.	BMJ Evid Based Med	23/09/2025
10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e19582	Antibacterial activity and mechanism of cinnamon essential oil nanoemulsion against Pseudomonas deceptionensis CM2.	Zhao D; Ma Y; Wang W; Xiang Q	This work aimed to evaluate the antibacterial activity and mechanism of cinnamon essential oil nanoemulsion (CON) against Pseudomonas deceptionensis CM2. The results revealed that CON could effectively inhibit the proliferation of P. deceptionensis CM2 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. After 4 h of incubation with CON at the minimum inhibitory concentration (0.125 mg/mL), the relative fluorescence intensity of propidium iodide and 1-N-phenylnapthylamine (NPN) was increased by 32.0% and 351.4%, respectively. The membrane permeability of P. deceptionensis CM2 cells was significantly disrupted after CON treatment, resulting in the leakage of intracellular substances (such as proteins and electrolytes). CON also caused significant increases in the DiBAC(4)(3) fluorescence intensity of P. deceptionensis CM2 cells. These results demonstrate that CON induced inactivation of P. deceptionensis CM2 by destroying the integrity and function of bacterial membrane. A higher level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed in CON-treated cells (p &lt; 0.05), compared with control cells. Moreover, the addition of glutathione to the growth medium remarkably decreased the antimicrobial activity of CON against P. deceptionensis CM2, further confirming that oxidative stress played an important role in the antimicrobial activity of CON. Overall, CON may exhibit antibacterial effects by causing damage to the bacterial membranes and oxidative stress.	Heliyon	01/09/2023
10.1093/nar/gkaf920	RNA/DNA-binding protein TDP43 regulates DNA mismatch repair genes with implications for genome stability.	Provasek VE; Bacolla A; Rangaswamy S; Kodavati M; Mitra J; Yusuf IO; Malojirao VH; Vasquez V; Britz GW; Li GM; Xu Z; Mitra S; Garruto RM; Tainer JA; Hegde ML	TDP43 is an RNA/DNA-binding protein increasingly recognized for its role in neurodegenerative conditions, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). As characterized by its aberrant nuclear export and cytoplasmic aggregation, TDP43 proteinopathy is a hallmark feature in over 95% of ALS/FTD cases, leading to detrimental cytosolic aggregates and a reduction in nuclear functionality in neurons. Building on our prior work linking TDP43 proteinopathy to the accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in neurons, the present investigation uncovers a novel regulatory relationship between TDP43 and DNA mismatch repair (MMR) gene expression. Here, we show that TDP43 depletion or overexpression directly affects the expression of key MMR genes. Alterations include changes in MLH1, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, and PMS2 levels across various primary cell lines, independent of their proliferative status. Our results specifically establish that TDP43 selectively influences the expression of MLH1 and MSH6 by influencing their alternative transcript splicing patterns and stability. We furthermore find that aberrant MMR gene expression is linked to TDP43 proteinopathy in two distinct ALS mouse models and in post-mortem brain and spinal cord tissues of ALS patients. Notably, MMR depletion resulted in the partial rescue of TDP43 proteinopathy-induced DNA damage and signaling. Moreover, bioinformatics analysis of the TCGA cancer database reveals significant associations between TDP43 expression, MMR gene expression, and mutational burden across multiple cancers. Collectively, our findings implicate TDP43 as a critical regulator of the MMR pathway and unveil its broad impact on the etiology of both neurodegenerative and neoplastic pathologies.

10.1586/17512433.2014.944502	New problems arising from old drugs: second-generation effects of acetaminophen.	Tiegs G; Karimi K; Brune K; Arck P	Acetaminophen (APAP)/paracetamol is one of the most commonly used over-the-counter drugs taken worldwide for treatment of pain and fever. Although considered as safe when taken in recommended doses not higher than 4 g/day, APAP overdose is currently the most important cause of acute liver failure (ALF). ALF may require liver transplantation and can be fatal. The reasons for APAP-related ALF are mostly intentional (suicidal) or unintentional overdose. However, results from large scale epidemiological studies provide increasing evidence for second generation effects of APAP, even when taken in pharmacological doses. Most strikingly, APAP medication during pregnancy has been associated with health problems including neurodevelopmental and behavioral disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and increase in the risk of wheezing and incidence of asthma among offspring. This article reviews the epidemiological findings and aims to shed light into the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for APAP-mediated prenatal risk for asthma.

Cytosolic DNA activates the cGAS-STING pathway to induce type I interferons (IFNs) and signaling through NF-κB, thus instigating host defenses and pathological inflammation. However, the mechanism underlying STING-induced NF-κB activation is unknown. Here we report that STING activates NF-κB in a delayed manner, following exit from the Golgi to endolysosomal compartments. Activation of NF-κB is dependent on the IFN-inducing transcription factor IRF3 but is independent of type I IFN signaling. This activation pattern is evolutionarily conserved in tetrapods. Mechanistically, the monomer IRF3 is recruited to STING pS358, with delayed kinetics relative to IRF3 recruitment to STING pS366, which promotes type I IFN responses. IRF3 engagement with STING pS358 induces trafficking to late endolysosomal compartments, supporting recruitment of TRAF6 and activation of NF-κB. We identify a TRAF6 binding motif in IRF3 that facilitates recruitment of TRAF6. This work defines a signaling surface on STING and a function for IRF3 as an adaptor in immune signaling. These findings indicate that STING signaling to NF-κB is enabled only within a short time window between exit from the Golgi and lysosomal degradation, possibly limiting inflammation under homeostatic and danger-sensing conditions.

Formal testing is needed to characterize the presence, severity, and patterns of olfactory dysfunction. OBJECTIVE: To characterize long-term olfactory dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study included adults enrolled in the Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER)-Adult study. All those with and a random sample of those without self-reported change or loss in smell or taste were offered olfactory testing, performed at 83 sites in 35 US states and territories. Participants included 2956 enrollees with prior infection (1393 with and 1563 without self-reported change or loss) and 569 without prior infection (9 with and 560 without self-reported change or loss in taste) who underwent olfactory testing a mean (SD) of 671.6 (417.8) days after the index date. Data were collected from October 29, 2021, to June 6, 2025. EXPOSURE: SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Olfactory function, as defined by age- and sex-standardized performance on the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), a well-validated test comprising 40 unique odors. RESULTS: The study included 3525 participants with a mean (SD) age of 47.6 (15.2) years; of 3520 with data available, 2548 (72.4%) were female or intersex. Among 1393 infected participants with self-reported change or loss, 1111 (79.8%) had hyposmia on the UPSIT, including 321 (23.0%) with severe microsmia or anosmia. Among 1563 infected participants without self-reported change or loss, 1031 (66.0%) had hyposmia, including 128 (8.2%) with severe microsmia or anosmia. Participants with prior infection and self-reported change or loss scored at the 16th age- and sex-standardized UPSIT percentile, compared with the 23rd and 28th percentiles for those without self-reported change or loss with and without prior known infection, respectively. Younger women had scores corresponding to lower mean age- and sex-standardized percentiles. Among participants who self-reported change or loss in smell, those with abnormal UPSIT scores more often reported cognitive problems (742 of 1111 [66.8%]) than those with normal UPSIT scores (179 of 282 [63.5%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of RECOVER-Adult participants, self-reported change or loss in smell or taste was an accurate signal of verified hyposmia, but a high rate of hyposmia among those with no reported change or loss was also observed. Formal smell testing may be considered in those with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection to diagnose occult hyposmia and counsel patients about risks.	JAMA Netw Open	02/09/2025

Treatments that influence this dysregulated host response are sparse. The immunopathophysiology of sepsis entails overzealous inflammation causing acute organ dysfunction, as well as a profound and/or persistent anti-inflammatory response that increases susceptibility to secondary infection. The immune response in sepsis is under the influence of various endogenous and exogenous factors, including genetic makeup, age, sex, comorbidities, metabolism, prior microbial exposure and medications. The consequent heterogeneity of the syndrome hampers immunomodulatory treatment strategies that rely on a &#x27;one-size-fits-all&#x27; approach. A precision medicine approach is therefore warranted. Balanced application of prognostic- and predictive-enrichment strategies is instrumental to achieve precision medicine. Phenotyping of patients using clinical, physiological, microbiological and/or molecular (&#x27;omics&#x27;) data enables the identification of more homogeneous patient subgroups. Several studies suggest that such approaches can be used to tailor adjunctive immunomodulatory therapies in patients with sepsis. As well as repurposing existing drugs to treat sepsis, new drugs aimed at restoring immune homeostasis are under investigation. New clinical trial methodologies, including flexible platform trials, Bayesian statistics and embedding trials in health care systems are increasingly being used to keep pace with rapid developments in the field of sepsis immunobiology and ultimately to improve clinical outcomes.

10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01438-2	The future of type 1 diabetes therapy.	Ziegler AG; Cengiz E; Kay TWH	The treatment of type 1 diabetes is entering a transformative era. Teplizumab, the first immunotherapy treatment to delay the onset of clinical type 1 diabetes, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Other immune-based therapies show promise in preserving β-cell function. Public health screening using islet autoantibodies is expanding, enabling earlier diagnosis, reducing diabetic ketoacidosis, and allowing timely introduction of disease-modifying treatments before the need for insulin therapy. β-cell replacement is shifting from traditional transplantation of organ donor islets and the pancreas to stem cell-derived β cells. Bioengineering methods, such as encapsulation, and gene editing to create hypoimmune cells could reduce the need for immunosuppression that has hampered β-cell replacement, and patient-derived stem cells open doors to personalised therapies. Although these innovations have been made available to a small number of patients, scaling them to widespread use remains a challenge. Meanwhile, glucose regulation is improving through the use of automated insulin delivery systems that combine glucose monitoring with insulin pumps. New-generation insulins (those that are ultrarapid, ultralong, and glucose-responsive) improve outcomes by minimising blood sugar fluctuations. Together, these breakthroughs offer renewed hope for improving long-term management and quality of life for people living with type 1 diabetes.	Lancet	19/09/2025
10.1002/alz.70730	PINK1 deficiency permits the development of Lewy body dementia with coexisting Aβ pathology.	Gao TY; Wang XZ; Xie YH; Wang T; Lu YB; Huang LL; Chen C; Zhang M; Ma X; Chen YL; Liang FX; Lou ZL; Li JS; Yu YF; Wu JB; Ma XR; Wang HL; Tang C; Zhang WP	INTRODUCTION: Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), a prevalent neurodegenerative dementia, involves α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates and frequent amyloid beta (Aβ) co-pathology, but mechanistic drivers remain unclear. METHODS: We crossed pink1 knockout with APP/PS1 mice, and assessed behavioral and pathological phenotypes of the resulting animals. We also performed biochemical and biophysical characterizations of PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) phosphorylation of α-syn. RESULTS: DLB brains show PINK1 deficiency alongside α-syn and Aβ co-pathology. Mirroring human DLB patients, APP/PS1::pink1-/- mice spontaneously develop Lewy pathology at endogenous α-syn levels, affecting both central and peripheral nervous systems with heterogeneous phenotypes. Mechanistically, PINK1 phosphorylates α-syn at Thr44, suppressing Aβ-induced α-syn aggregation. Moreover, pT44-α-syn levels are correlated with PINK1 expression and activity in human brains. DISCUSSION: PINK1 deficiency synergizes with Aβ to promote Lewy pathology via loss of protective α-syn phosphorylation. The APP/PS1::pink1-/- model recapitulates key DLB features without α-syn overexpression, offering a valuable tool for future mechanistic and therapeutic studies. HIGHLIGHTS: PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) deficiency, either through reduced expression or impaired activity, is found in human dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) patients with amyloid beta (Aβ) co-pathology. PINK1 specifically phosphorylates α-synuclein at Thr44, inhibiting Aβ-induced aggregation and preventing the development of Lewy pathology. The APP/PS1::pink1-/- mouse model recapitulates key features of human DLB, exhibiting widespread Lewy pathology and heterogeneous phenotypes. PINK1 alterations emerge as a novel genetic risk factor for DLB, opening new avenues for diagnosis and therapeutic intervention.	Alzheimers Dement	01/09/2025
10.1038/s41467-025-63395-1	Clinical implications of bone marrow adiposity identified by phenome-wide association and Mendelian randomization in the UK Biobank.	Xu W; Mesa-Eguiagaray I; Morris DM; Wang C; Gray CD; Sjöström S; Papanastasiou G; Badr S; Paccou J; Wang L; Li X; Timmers PRHJ; Timofeeva M; Semple SI; MacGillivray T; Theodoratou E; Cawthorn WP	Bone marrow adiposity changes in diverse diseases, but the full scope of these, and whether they are directly influenced by marrow adiposity, remains unknown. To address this, we previously measured the bone marrow fat fraction of the femoral head, total hip, femoral diaphysis, and spine of over 48,000 UK Biobank participants. Here, we first use these data for PheWAS to identify diseases associated with marrow adiposity at each site. This reveals associations with 47 incident diseases across 12 disease categories, including osteoporosis, fracture, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and other conditions that burden public health worldwide. Intriguingly, type 2 diabetes associates positively with spine bone marrow adiposity but negatively with marrow adiposity at femoral sites. We then establish PRSs based on bone-marrow-fat-fraction-associated SNPs and use PRS-PheWAS and Mendelian randomization to explore causal associations between marrow adiposity and disease. PRS-PheWAS reveals that genetic predisposition to increased marrow adiposity is positively associated with osteoporosis and fractures. Mendelian randomization further suggests that increased marrow adiposity at the diaphysis and total hip is causally associated with osteoporosis. Our findings substantially advance understanding of how marrow adiposity impacts human health and highlight its potential as a biomarker and/or therapeutic target for diverse human diseases.

10.1038/s41586-021-03279-8	Centromeres are dismantled by foundational meiotic proteins Spo11 and Rec8.	Hou H; Kyriacou E; Thadani R; Klutstein M; Chapman JH; Cooper JP	Meiotic processes are potentially dangerous to genome stability and could be disastrous if activated in proliferative cells. Here we show that two key meiosis-defining proteins, the topoisomerase Spo11 (which forms double-strand breaks) and the meiotic cohesin Rec8, can dismantle centromeres. This dismantlement is normally observable only in mutant cells that lack the telomere bouquet, which provides a nuclear microdomain conducive to centromere reassembly(1); however, overexpression of Spo11 or Rec8 leads to levels of centromere dismantlement that cannot be countered by the bouquet. Specific nucleosome remodelling factors mediate centromere dismantlement by Spo11 and Rec8. Ectopic expression of either protein in proliferating cells leads to the loss of mitotic kinetochores in both fission yeast and human cells. Hence, while centromeric chromatin has been characterized as extraordinarily stable, Spo11 and Rec8 challenge this stability and may jeopardize kinetochores in cancers that express meiotic proteins.

10.1038/s41418-025-01584-7	A novel lncRNA, lncMCL1, modulates neural pyroptosis associated with epilepsy via stabilizing DDX3X.	Wang H; Wu L; Liu C; Zhao X; Cui L; Gao J; Zhang C; Du T; Shi L; Ji Y; Xiao Y; Zhang J; Tu W; Meng F; Han C	Pyroptosis is strongly associated with refractory epilepsy. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Increasing evidence has shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in various neurological disorder processes by regulating programmed cell death. In this study, we identified a novel lncRNA, lncMCL1, by high-throughput screening, which suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent neural pyroptosis in epilepsy. We demonstrated that lncMCL1 is aberrantly underexpressed in the hippocampus and cortex of epilepsy patients, a phenomenon that was validated in various mouse and rat epilepsy models. Through CRISPR/Cas9, siRNA, and viral manipulation, gain- and loss-of-function experiments confirmed that lncMCL1 inhibits neuronal pyroptosis in vivo and in vitro and exerts antiepileptic effects. Mechanistically, lncMCL1 acts as a scaffold to modulate DDX3X protein stabilization by enhancing NEDD4-mediated DDX3X K48 ubiquitination, thereby inhibiting neural pyroptosis through the suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome signalling. Additionally, IL-18/IL-1β, downstream cytokines of pyroptosis, inhibit lncMCL1 expression through the activation of a shared pathway, the STAT3 pathway, forming a feedback loop. Our findings identify lncMCL1 as a critical regulator of neural cell pyroptosis and a promising therapeutic target for refractory epilepsy.	Cell Death Differ	22/09/2025
10.1002/jev2.70164	Sphingolipids in Extracellular Vesicles Released From the Skeletal Muscle Plasma Membrane Control Muscle Stem Cell Fate During Muscle Regeneration.	Hakkar R; Brun CE; Leblanc P; Meugnier E; Berger-Danty E; Blanc-Brude O; Tacconi S; Jalabert A; Reininger L; Pesenti S; Calzada C; Gache V; Vasan SB; Pichon J; Larcher T; Errazuriz-Cerda E; Cassin C; Sung BH; Weaver A; Bongiovanni A; Rouger K; de Barros JP; Bouzakri K; Rome S	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent a cytokine-independent pathway though which skeletal muscle (SkM) cells influence the fate of neighbouring cells, thereby regulating SkM metabolic homeostasis and regeneration. Although SkM-EVs are increasingly being explored as a therapeutic strategy to enhance muscle regeneration or to induce the myogenic differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), the mechanisms governing their release from muscle cells remain poorly described. Moreover, because muscle regeneration involves a tightly regulated inflammatory response it also important to determine how inflammation alters SkM-EV cargo and function in order to design more effective EV-based therapies. To address this knowledge gap, we isolated and characterized the large and small EVs (lEVs, sEVs) released from SkM cells under basal conditions and in response to TNF-α, a well-established inflammatory mediator elevated in both acute muscle injury and chronic inflammatory conditions such as type 2 diabetes. We then evaluated the regenerative roles of these EV subtypes in vivo using a mouse model of cardiotoxin-induced muscle injury, with a specific focus on their bioactive sphingolipid content. Using transmission, scanning or cryo-electron microscopy, lipidomic profiling and an adenoviral construct to express labelled CD63 in myotubes, we demonstrated that SkM cells release both sEVs and lEVs primarily from the plasma membrane. Notably, sEVs were generated from specialized membrane folds enriched in the EV markers ALIX (ALG-2 interacting protein X) and TSG101, as well as lipid raft-associated lipids. During regeneration, sEVs promoted M1 macrophage polarization and migration and muscle stem cell (MuSC) differentiation, thereby accelerating muscle repair. In contrast, lEVs inhibited and promoted MuSC proliferation and impaired the transition from the pro-inflammatory to the anti-inflammatory response, an essential step for promoting MuSC differentiation. Treatment of isolated muscle fibres with SkM-EVs revealed that the distinct effects of sEVs and lEVs on MuSC behaviour and macrophage phenotype could be largely explained by differences in their lipid composition, particularly the ratio of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) subspecies. However, TNF-α exposure altered these ratios in sEVs and impaired their regenerative functions on MuSC and their effect on macrophage migration and polarization. These results demonstrate for the first time the importance of the sphingolipid content of EVs released by skeletal muscle in their regenerative function within muscle tissue, largely explained by their role as carriers of different subspecies of sphingosine-1-phosphate. This suggests that modulating the sphingolipid composition of EVs could be a viable strategy to enhance the regenerative potential of muscle tissue in addition to therapeutic interventions.

10.1186/s12944-025-02716-1	Association between atherogenic index of plasma and tinnitus: evidence from NHANES and the mediating role of hypertension.	Miao W; Wu C; Yuan D; Li Y; Wu T	BACKGROUND: Tinnitus is a prevalent auditory disorder that significantly affects quality of life, with emerging evidence suggesting a connection between metabolic dysregulation and tinnitus pathogenesis. The Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP), a marker of atherogenic lipid metabolism, has been associated with cardiovascular disease risk but remains underexplored in the context of tinnitus. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between AIP and tinnitus prevalence in U.S. adults, and to further examine whether hypertension mediates this association. METHODS: We analyzed data from 2,464 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2005-2012). Tinnitus status was determined by self-report, and AIP was calculated as log10(triglycerides/HDL-C). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the association between AIP and tinnitus. Stratified analyses and mediation analysis were conducted to explore effect modification and the mediating role of hypertension. Hypertension was defined as a self-reported physician diagnosis or use of antihypertensive medication. RESULTS: Elevated AIP was significantly associated with an increased risk of tinnitus in a dose-response manner (fully adjusted OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.19-2.52, P = 0.01). Stronger associations were observed in younger participants, females, non-Hispanic Whites, and smokers. Mediation analysis showed that hypertension partially mediated the association between AIP and Tinnitus, accounting for 17.53% of the total effect. CONCLUSIONS: Higher AIP is associated with greater tinnitus prevalence, with hypertension serving as a partial mediator. These findings highlight the potential value of AIP as a metabolic biomarker for tinnitus risk stratification and emphasize the importance of managing metabolic dysregulation in tinnitus prevention.

10.1038/s41556-025-01749-z	Membrane receptors cluster phosphatidylserine to activate LC3-associated phagocytosis.	Boada-Romero E; Guy CS; Palacios G; Mari L; Poudel S; Li Z; Sharma P; Green DR	LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) represents a non-canonical function of autophagy proteins in which ATG8-family proteins (LC3 and GABARAP proteins) are lipidated onto single-membrane phagosomes as particles are engulfed by phagocytic cells. LAP plays roles in innate immunity, inflammation and anticancer responses, and is initiated following phagocytosis of particles that stimulate Toll-like receptors (TLR) and Fc receptors as well as following engulfment of dying cells. However, how this molecular process is initiated remains elusive. Here we report that receptors that engage LAP enrich phosphatidylserine (PS) in the phagosome membrane via membrane-proximal domains that are necessary and sufficient for LAP to proceed. Subsequently, PS recruits the Rubicon-containing PI3-kinase complex to initiate the enzymatic cascade leading to LAP. Manipulation of plasma membrane PS content, PS binding by Rubicon or the PS-clustering domains of receptors prevents LAP and delays phagosome maturation. Therefore, the initiation of LAP represents a novel mechanism of PS-mediated signal transduction following ligation of surface receptors.	Nat Cell Biol	22/09/2025
10.1111/all.70061	Biologics to Treat Atopic Dermatitis: Effectiveness, Safety, and Future Directions.	de Bruin-Weller MS; Boesjes CM; Achten RA; Beck LA; Irvine AD; Vestergaard C; de Graaf M; van Wijk F; Bakker DS; Weidinger S	Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common chronic inflammatory skin diseases worldwide. The clinical presentation of AD is heterogeneous and is characterized by a relapsing and remitting course. Most patients suffer from mild AD while approximately 5% to 20% experience severe disease activity, which often requires systemic treatment. Before 2017, systemic treatment options were limited to broad immunosuppressants, which often had significant toxicity and limited effectiveness. Advances in understanding AD pathophysiology have led to the development of targeted biologic therapies, including dupilumab, tralokinumab, lebrikizumab, and nemolizumab. These monoclonal antibodies specifically block key pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in AD, improving disease control and symptom relief. Dupilumab, the first approved biologic, inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, while tralokinumab and lebrikizumab selectively block IL-13. Nemolizumab targets IL-31, which plays a crucial role in pruritus. This review summarizes primarily real-world data on the effectiveness and safety of these biologics, providing clinical guidance for their use and management of side effects. It also briefly discusses promising therapeutic targets currently in phase 3 trials.	Allergy	24/09/2025
10.1073/pnas.2506437122	Muscle-specific increased expression of JAG1 improves the skeletal muscle phenotype in dystrophin-deficient mice.	de Souza Leite F; Lambert MR; Zhang TY; Conner JR; Paulo JA; Oliveira SF; Guha Thakurta S; Bowles J; Gussoni E; Gygi SP; Widrick JJ; Kunkel LM	Therapeutic strategies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) will likely require complementary approaches. One possibility is to explore genetic modifiers that improve muscle regeneration and function. The beneficial effects of the overexpression of Jagged-1 were described in escaper golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) dogs that had a near-normal life and validated in dystrophin-deficient zebrafish. To clarify the underlying biology of JAG1 overexpression in dystrophic muscles, we generated a transgenic mouse (mdx(5cv)-JAG1) model that lacks dystrophin and overexpresses human JAG1 in striated muscles. Skeletal muscles from mdx(5cv)-JAG1 and mdx(5cv) mice were studied at 1-, 4-, and 12-mo time points. JAG1 expression in mdx(5cv)-JAG1 increased by 3 to 5 times compared to mdx(5cv). Consequently, mdx(5cv)-JAG1 muscles were significantly bigger and stronger than dystrophic controls, along with an increased number of myofibers. Proteomics data show increased dysferlin in mdx(5cv)-JAG1 muscles and an association of the histone methyltransferase Nsd1 with the phenotype. Our data support the positive effect of JAG1 overexpression in dystrophic muscles.	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	30/09/2025
10.1001/jama.2024.3172	Acetaminophen Use During Pregnancy and Children&#x27;s Risk of Autism, ADHD, and Intellectual Disability.	Ahlqvist VH; Sjöqvist H; Dalman C; Karlsson H; Stephansson O; Johansson S; Magnusson C; Gardner RM; Lee BK	IMPORTANCE: Several studies suggest that acetaminophen (paracetamol) use during pregnancy may increase risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children. If true, this would have substantial implications for management of pain and fever during pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations of acetaminophen use during pregnancy with children&#x27;s risk of autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and intellectual disability. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nationwide cohort study with sibling control analysis included a population-based sample of 2 480 797 children born in 1995 to 2019 in Sweden, with follow-up through December 31, 2021. EXPOSURE: Use of acetaminophen during pregnancy prospectively recorded from antenatal and prescription records. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Autism, ADHD, and intellectual disability based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes in health registers. RESULTS: In total, 185 909 children (7.49%) were exposed to acetaminophen during pregnancy. Crude absolute risks at 10 years of age for those not exposed vs those exposed to acetaminophen were 1.33% vs 1.53% for autism, 2.46% vs 2.87% for ADHD, and 0.70% vs 0.82% for intellectual disability. In models without sibling control, ever-use vs no use of acetaminophen during pregnancy was associated with marginally increased risk of autism (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05 [95% CI, 1.02-1.08]; risk difference [RD] at 10 years of age, 0.09% [95% CI, -0.01% to 0.20%]), ADHD (HR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.05-1.10]; RD, 0.21% [95% CI, 0.08%-0.34%]), and intellectual disability (HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 1.00-1.10]; RD, 0.04% [95% CI, -0.04% to 0.12%]). To address unobserved confounding, matched full sibling pairs were also analyzed. Sibling control analyses found no evidence that acetaminophen use during pregnancy was associated with autism (HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.93-1.04]; RD, 0.02% [95% CI, -0.14% to 0.18%]), ADHD (HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.94-1.02]; RD, -0.02% [95% CI, -0.21% to 0.15%]), or intellectual disability (HR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.92-1.10]; RD, 0% [95% CI, -0.10% to 0.13%]). Similarly, there was no evidence of a dose-response pattern in sibling control analyses. For example, for autism, compared with no use of acetaminophen, persons with low (&lt;25th percentile), medium (25th-75th percentile), and high (&gt;75th percentile) mean daily acetaminophen use had HRs of 0.85, 0.96, and 0.88, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Acetaminophen use during pregnancy was not associated with children&#x27;s risk of autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability in sibling control analysis. This suggests that associations observed in other models may have been attributable to familial confounding.	JAMA	09/04/2024
10.1212/WNL.0000000000214144	Intrinsic Capacity Defined Using 4 Domains, Genetic Risk, and Incident Parkinson Disease: A Prospective Cohort Study.	Hu W; Tian G; Wang JN; Ma YB; Zheng ZA; Feng TJ; Niu XX; Yan YN; Liu BP; Jia CX	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Intrinsic capacity (IC), a World Health Organization-defined measure of healthy aging, has been linked to several neurologic disorders but has not been extrapolated to Parkinson disease (PD). The study aimed to explore the association between IC and incident PD and whether genetic risk modulated this association. METHODS: This longitudinal analysis used data from the UK Biobank, a prospective cohort study designed to investigate the impact of genetic and environmental factors on health outcomes. Participants were voluntarily recruited from 22 assessment centers across the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2010. Individuals with IC component data and without pre-existing PD or dementia at baseline were included. The IC deficit score was derived from 4 domains: psychological (exhaustion and sleep duration), sensory (visual and hearing impairments), vitality (grip strength and weight loss), and locomotor function (walking speed), while the cognitive domain was not assessed. Genetic risk was estimated by polygenic risk score, and incident PD was identified using an algorithm. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. RESULTS: Of the 401,791 participants (mean age [SD], 56.6 [8.0] years; 53.8% female) included, 2,763 (0.69%) developed PD during a median follow-up of 12.3 years. The HR (95% CI) for incident PD was 1.82 (1.50-2.20) in individuals with IC deficit scores of 4+ compared with those with 0. Each 1-point increment in IC deficit was associated with a 16% (95% CI 12%-20%) increased risk of PD. Low IC was associated with a 68% (95% CI 48%-91%) higher risk of incident PD. Individuals with low IC and high genetic risk were at the highest PD risk (HR = 3.01; 95% CI 2.40-3.78). High genetic risk attenuated the protective role of high IC (HR [95% CI]: 0.45 [0.35-0.58] in low risk vs 0.72 [0.59-0.88] in high risk; P for interaction = 0.002), but high IC was still associated with a diminished risk of PD in the high-risk group. DISCUSSION: High IC was associated with a decreased risk of PD, even in genetically high-risk individuals. The absence of the cognitive domain may limit understanding of the association.

10.1126/scitranslmed.ads5769	Retinal polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation reverses aging-related vision decline in mice.	Gao F; Tom E; Rydz C; Cho W; Kolesnikov AV; Sha Y; Papadam A; Jafari S; Joseph A; Ahanchi A; Balalaei Someh Saraei N; Lyon DC; Foik A; Nie Q; Grassmann F; Kefalov VJ; Skowronska-Krawczyk D	The retina is uniquely enriched in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), primarily localized in cell membranes, where they govern membrane biophysical properties. During aging, alterations in lipid metabolism lead to reduced content of very long-chain PUFAs (VLC-PUFAs) in the retina, which is associated with normal age-related reductions in contrast sensitivity, diminished photoreceptor function and delayed rod-mediated dark adaptation recovery, and pathological age-related macular degeneration (AMD). ELOVL2 (elongation of very long chain fatty acids-like 2) encodes a transmembrane protein that produces precursors to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and VLC-PUFAs. The methylation status of the ELOVL2 promoter is currently one of the best predictors of chronological age. Here, we show that lower VLC-PUFA abundance in the aged mouse retina is accompanied by a reduction in visual function. Similarly, mice lacking ELOVL2-specific enzymatic activity (Elovl2(C234W)) demonstrate reduced contrast sensitivity and slower rod-mediated dark adaptation. Intravitreal supplementation with the direct product of ELOVL2, 24:5n-3, in aged animals improved visual function for up to 4 weeks and reduced accumulation of APOE- and C3d-positive sub-RPE deposits. The gene expression pattern observed in supplemented retinas exhibited a partial rejuvenation profile, including decreased expression of aging-related genes and a transcriptomic signature resembling younger retinas. Last, human genetic data from the IAMDGC and UK Biobank linked two variants in the ELOVL2 locus with the onset of intermediate AMD, underlining the translational importance of our findings. Our work highlights VLC-PUFA supplementation as a potential therapeutic opportunity and defines ELOVL2 as a promising target for interventions to prevent age-related vision loss.

10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.072312	PYGM Protects Against Myocardial Infarction by Enhancing Glycogenolysis and Facilitating Autophagic Flux.	Gan J; Zhao R; Zheng D; Peng Y; Wu M; Sun F; An R; Xu A; Chen M; Li Y; Lei W; Lin Z; Wu F	BACKGROUND: PYGM (muscle glycogen phosphorylase), the rate-limiting enzyme in glycogenolysis, plays an indispensable role in maintaining cardiac energy metabolism. However, the role of PYGM in the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction (MI) remains unclear. METHODS: The expression profiles of PYGM in cardiac tissues and plasma samples from subjects with MI were assessed using immunoblotting. The role of PYGM in MI was determined by evaluating the effects of PYGM deficiency and its replenishment through adeno-associated virus-mediated PYGM expression in mice with MI. RESULTS: We found that circulating PYGM levels and their cardiac contents were significantly decreased in patients with MI, which was associated with impaired cardiac function. Loss of PYGM significantly exacerbated MI-induced cardiac dysfunction and damage in mice, and replenishment of PYGM profoundly reversed these adverse effects. Mechanistically, PYGM enhanced glycogenolysis by activating glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, thereby improving cardiac energy homeostasis and mitigating oxidative stress. In addition, PYGM improved MI-induced autophagic flux obstacles and alleviated MI-induced cardiac damage by suppressing the expression of Thbs1 (thrombospondin-1). Moreover, genetic deficiency or pharmacological blockage of autophagy attenuated the protective effects of PYGM against MI-induced cardiac injury, and cardiac-specific knockdown of Thbs1 substantially improved the adverse impact of MI on cardiac dysfunction and damage in PYGM-null mice. CONCLUSIONS: PYGM safeguards against MI-induced myocardial injury by stimulating glycogenolysis and promoting autophagic flux, thus preserving myocardial energy homeostasis.	Circulation	24/09/2025
10.1016/j.devcel.2025.07.002	Emerging insights into lineage plasticity in pancreatic cancer initiation, progression, and therapy resistance.	Zhang X; Du Y; Behrens A; Lan L	Lineage plasticity, the ability of cells to switch from one specialized identity to another, is a fundamental cellular process in embryonic development and tissue regeneration. The process is often hijacked by tumor cells at various stages to facilitate cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance. It is also recognized as a key contributor to intratumor heterogeneity (ITH). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), lineage plasticity is central to acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and its associated acinar-to-ductal reprogramming (ADR), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer stem cell (CSC) regeneration, and molecular subtype rewiring. These mechanisms generate diverse lineage trajectories that shape PDAC development, progression, and therapeutic outcomes. In this review, we discuss how normal and tumor cells in the pancreatic epithelium acquire lineage plasticity and its implications for PDAC pathogenesis, ITH, metastasis, and therapy resistance. We also highlight recent discoveries suggesting potential therapeutic strategies targeting key regulators of lineage plasticity in PDAC.	Dev Cell	22/09/2025
10.1111/all.70060	Distinct Roles of IL-4, IL-13, and IL-22 in Human Skin Barrier Dysfunction and Atopic Dermatitis.	D&#x27;Avino P; Kim J; Li M; Gessner P; Westermann P; Pat Y; Beha C; Traidl-Hoffmann C; Bost J; Gaudenzio N; Messner CB; Akdis CA; Mitamura Y	BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic type-2 inflammatory skin disease characterized by eczema and epithelial barrier dysfunction. Along with the type-2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, IL-22 contributes to AD pathogenesis. To date, most skin studies rely on reconstructed keratinocytes, which do not represent the real skin response. OBJECTIVE: Here, we report the distinct effects of IL-4, IL-13, and IL-22 on bio-stabilized human skin with intact barriers and immune cells. METHODS: Spatial transcriptomics on AD-lesions and non-lesional skin was performed. Ex vivo skin barrier integrity was evaluated using electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), RNA-sequencing, and untargeted proteomics, complemented by analyses of skin biopsies from dupilumab-treated AD patients. RESULTS: Spatial transcriptomics demonstrated that AD lesions showed reduced expression of key barrier genes, including CLDN1, FLG, and FLG2. IL-4, IL-13, and IL-22 disrupted the skin barrier in the ex vivo human skin. Combining type-2 cytokines and IL-22 alone downregulated genes critical for barrier function and keratinization. In addition, IL-4 and IL-13 downregulated antimicrobial peptides, while IL-22 upregulated them. Interestingly, IL-4 and IL-13 reduced IL-22Rα1, and IL-22 upregulated IL-4Rα, suggesting immune cross-regulation. Proteomic analysis confirmed that all three cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, and IL-22) reduced the expression of key skin barrier proteins, particularly filaggrin and claudin-1. Dupilumab treatment of AD patients for 3 months restored IL-4/IL-13-dysregulated genes, whereas it had limited effect on IL22-associated pathways. CONCLUSION: This comprehensive study provides insights into the distinct immune profiles following IL-4, IL-13, and IL-22 stimulation on human skin, highlighting their complex interplay in disrupting skin barrier function and modulating innate immune responses.

10.1136/gutjnl-2025-335103	Gastrin-dependent expansion of Cck2r(+) corpus progenitors accelerates ulcer healing and inhibits gastric dysplasia.	Zheng B; Kobayashi H; Tu R; Huang K; Zhi X; Lian G; Wu F; Qian J; Ochiai Y; Waterbury QT; Malagola E; Lu J; Hata M; Zeng Y; Zheng H; Zhang P; Li S; Zamechek L; Wang X; Chen F; Wang TC	BACKGROUND: The cholecystokinin-2/gastrin receptor (Cck2r) is expressed in corpus isthmus progenitor, enterochromaffin-like and parietal cells, regulating acid secretion and cell turnover. However, the role of gastrin on Cck2r progenitors during mucosal regeneration remains unexplored. OBJECTIVE: To study the role of gastrin-Cck2r axis and corpus progenitors during gastric injury and regeneration. DESIGN: We generated Cck2r-CreERT2; Gastrin-DTR-p2A-TdTomato; Rosa26-ZsGreen mice to trace corpus Cck2r(+) progenitors during homeostasis and injury, under conditions of hypogastrinaemia and hypergastrinaemia. Injury models included acute ulceration, chronic H. pylori gastritis and N-Nitroso-N-Methylurea (MNU) exposure. RESULTS: Hypergastrinaemia significantly expanded Cck2r(+) isthmus progenitors, whereas hypogastrinaemia reduced them. Gastric ulceration induced a twofold elevation in plasma gastrin by day 14, antral G-cell expansion and complete ulcer healing by day 28. Gastrin infusion or proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment further elevated gastrin and promoted complete ulcer healing by day 14, whereas G-cell ablation minimised gastrin, impaired healing and abrogated the benefits of PPI (p&lt;0.05). The vagus nerve, through the muscarinic receptor 3, mediated both gastrin elevations and Cck2r(+) progenitor expansion during ulcer healing. G-cell ablation in H. pylori-infected mice increased colonisation and exacerbated inflammation, atrophy, metaplasia and dysplasia (p&lt;0.05), while hypergastrinaemia was protective. Similarly, in the MNU model, G-cell ablation worsened gastric pathology while hypergastrinaemia mitigated it. CONCLUSIONS: We report a novel role for G-cell-derived gastrin in ulcer healing. Hypogastrinaemia is a risk factor for poor ulcer healing, corpus atrophy and potentially cancer, while physiological gastrin responses are protective. PPI-induced hypergastrinaemia plays a key role in ulcer healing, and gastrin signalling may prevent gastric preneoplasia.	Gut	22/09/2025
10.1136/thorax-2024-222397	Proteomics-based risk prediction and drug targets identification for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	Zhang Y; Ye Z; Yang S; Zhang Y; Huang Y; Xiang H; Wu Y; Zhang Y; Gan X; Qin X	BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of global mortality, yet existing risk prediction models remain limited. This study aimed to develop and validate a protein-based risk score for COPD, comparing its performance against COPD polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and clinical risk factors, while exploring underlying biological pathways and causal protein-disease associations. METHODS: The study analysed 27 796 UK Biobank participants from England (70% training and 30% testing set) and 3534 from Scotland/Wales (validation cohort). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression identified predictive proteins in the training set, with model performance assessed using Harrell&#x27;s C-index, Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI) and Integrated Discrimination Improvement Index (IDI). Pathway and Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses explored biological mechanisms and causal effects. RESULTS: In the testing set, a developed 32-protein risk score strongly predicted incident COPD with high accuracy (C-index 0.826, 95% CI 0.803 to 0.849). It outperformed PRS (C-index 0.510, 95% CI 0.478 to 0.542) and matched clinical models (C-index 0.845, 95% CI 0.823 to 0.867). A simplified 10-protein panel retained robust performance (C-index 0.816, 95% CI 0.792 to 0.840). Adding the protein scores to clinical factors improved risk reclassification (NRI 0.251-0.318; IDI: 0.042-0.064). MR analysis identified ADM and SCGB1A1 as protective, while MMP12 and TNFRSF10A increased risk. Pathway analysis implicated inflammation and extracellular remodelling. Chitinase-3-like protein 1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 were central players in the protein-protein interaction network. Similar results were found in the validation cohort. CONCLUSION: Protein biomarkers outperform genetic risk scores and complement clinical factors for COPD prediction, with a streamlined 10-protein panel offering clinical feasibility. The study identifies novel pathways and causal therapeutic targets. Further validation is needed prior to routine clinical implementation.	Thorax	24/09/2025
10.1200/JCO-25-00925	Five-Year Outcomes of the POLARIX Study Comparing Pola-R-CHP and R-CHOP in Patients With Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.	Morschhauser F; Salles G; Sehn LH; Herrera AF; Friedberg JW; Trněný M; Lenz G; Sharman JP; Herbaux C; Burke JM; Matasar M; Collins GP; Mehta-Shah N; Oberic L; Chauchet A; Jurczak W; Song Y; Pinto A; Rai S; Izutsu K; Greil R; Mykhalska L; Bergua-Burgués JM; Cheung MC; Shin HJ; Hapgood G; Munhoz E; Abrisqueta P; Gau JP; Jiang Y; McCall B; Chohan S; Sugidono M; Yan M; Batlevi CL; Tilly H; Flowers CR	In the POLARIX study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03274492), polatuzumab vedotin plus rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (Pola-R-CHP) showed a significant progression-free survival (PFS) benefit versus rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) in patients with previously untreated intermediate- or high-risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; median follow-up: 28 months). In this 5-year update, sustained PFS benefits favoring Pola-R-CHP were observed. In the global intention-to-treat population (N = 879; median follow-up: 64.1 months), Pola-R-CHP demonstrated a significant PFS benefit over R-CHOP (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.97]), with 5-year PFS rates of 64.9% (95% CI, 59.8 to 70.0) and 59.1% (95% CI, 53.9 to 64.3), respectively. Although not statistically significant, overall survival analysis showed a HR of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.63 to 1.15) at the 5-year data cut compared with 0.94 (95% CI, 0.67 to 1.33) at the 2-year data cut. In the expanded population, 46 and 62 patients had lymphoma-related deaths in the Pola-R-CHP and R-CHOP arms, respectively. Exploratory analyses showed favorable 5-year survival rates with Pola-R-CHP in high-risk subgroups, including activated B-cell DLBCL and International Prognostic Index score 3-5. Long-term tolerability was similar between treatment arms. Findings confirm Pola-R-CHP represents a standard of care for frontline treatment of DLBCL.	J Clin Oncol	24/09/2025
10.1002/edm2.70113	Evaluating the Rates of Pancreatitis and Pancreatic Cancer Among GLP-1 Receptor Agonists: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials.	Wen J; Nadora D; Bernstein E; How-Volkman C; Truong A; Joy B; Kou M; Muttalib Z; Alam A; Frezza E	AIMS: This meta-analysis evaluates the rates of pancreatitis/pancreatic cancer among glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), a systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for GLP-1 RA RCTs that evaluated pancreatitis/pancreatic cancer. A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate this risk; subgroup analysis was performed with and without background medications. RESULTS: 62 studies utilising dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, semaglutide, beinaglutide, retatrutide, or tirzepatide, with 66,232 patients, mean age of 58.3 years (14.4 to 68), and mean follow-up of 43.5 weeks (1 to 198) were included in this study. Meta-analysis showed a significantly increased risk of pancreatitis (RR: 1.44, 95% CI 1.09-1.89, p = 0.009), but not when stratified by background medications (RR: 1.28, 95% CI 0.87-1.87) and without background medications (RR: 1.37, 95% CI 0.91-2.05). Pancreatic cancer and GLP-1 RA use showed no significant association (RR: 1.30, 95% CI 0.86-1.97). However, a significant increase was found with background medications (RR: 1.85, 95% CI 1.05-3.26, p = 0.03), but not without (RR: 0.81, 95% CI 0.43-1.55). CONCLUSION: GLP-1 RAs carry a slightly increased risk of pancreatitis, which is not significant when stratified by background medication use. Overall risk for pancreatic cancer was not observed, but a slight association was found when stratified with background medications. However, this difference is likely minimal, given the numerous studies excluded from the meta-analysis where both treatment arms had zero events.	Endocrinol Diabetes Metab	01/09/2025
10.1007/s10654-021-00754-4	Prenatal and postnatal exposure to acetaminophen in relation to autism spectrum and attention-deficit and hyperactivity symptoms in childhood: Meta-analysis in six European population-based cohorts.	Alemany S; Avella-García C; Liew Z; García-Esteban R; Inoue K; Cadman T; López-Vicente M; González L; Riaño Galán I; Andiarena A; Casas M; Margetaki K; Strandberg-Larsen K; Lawlor DA; El Marroun H; Tiemeier H; Iñiguez C; Tardón A; Santa-Marina L; Júlvez J; Porta D; Chatzi L; Sunyer J	The potential etiological role of early acetaminophen exposure on Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is inconclusive. We aimed to study this association in a collaborative study of six European population-based birth/child cohorts. A total of 73,881 mother-child pairs were included in the study. Prenatal and postnatal (up to 18 months) acetaminophen exposure was assessed through maternal questionnaires or interviews. ASC and ADHD symptoms were assessed at 4-12 years of age using validated instruments. Children were classified as having borderline/clinical symptoms using recommended cutoffs for each instrument. Hospital diagnoses were also available in one cohort. Analyses were adjusted for child and maternal characteristics along with indications for acetaminophen use. Adjusted cohort-specific effect estimates were combined using random-effects meta-analysis. The proportion of children having borderline/clinical symptoms ranged between 0.9 and 12.9% for ASC and between 1.2 and 12.2% for ADHD. Results indicated that children prenatally exposed to acetaminophen were 19% and 21% more likely to subsequently have borderline or clinical ASC (OR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.07-1.33) and ADHD symptoms (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.07-1.36) compared to non-exposed children. Boys and girls showed higher odds for ASC and ADHD symptoms after prenatal exposure, though these associations were slightly stronger among boys. Postnatal exposure to acetaminophen was not associated with ASC or ADHD symptoms. These results replicate previous work and support providing clear information to pregnant women and their partners about potential long-term risks of acetaminophen use.	Eur J Epidemiol	01/10/2021
10.1016/j.phymed.2025.157262	Liquiritin in Chaihu-shugan-san alleviates Parkinson&#x27;s Disease via PPARα-mediated inhibition of SCD1/FADS2-dependent Ferroptosis.	Cai Y; Huang G; Shan C; Zhang X; YuYan L; Fu Y; Ren M; Yan T; Xu M; Zhu L	BACKGROUND: Parkinson&#x27;s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with increasing global prevalence. Chaihu-shugan-san (CSS) is a Chinese medicine compound with reported neuroprotective properties. However, the precise bioactive constituents and underlying mechanisms of CSS in the context of PD remain poorly defined. PURPOSE: This study aimed to systematically evaluate the therapeutic potential of CSS, characterize its bioactive constituents, and elucidate the potential molecular mechanisms in PD. METHODS: A network pharmacology-bioinformatics framework was established to predict the potential targets of CSS in PD. MPTP-induced PD mouse models were validated by behavioral tests, histopathology (HE staining), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and Western blot (WB). Machine learning and ROC curve analysis pinpointed key ferroptosis-related genes linked to CSS and PD, with functional enrichment highlighting possible pathways. Further validation was performed using IHC, GPx, MDA, and WB assays. UPLC-MS/MS was employed to characterize bioactive CSS components, followed by druggability screening, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In vitro, MES23.5 cells exposed to MPP⁺ were used to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of Liquiritin (LIQ), the principal active compound in CSS, via CCK-8, LDH, oxidative stress markers (GPx, MDA), lipid peroxidation (C11-BODIPY), iron accumulation (FerroOrange), and WB. Additional validation of ferroptosis modulation was performed in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: Multidisciplinary investigations employing prediction and experimental validation consistently demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of CSS against MPTP-induced PD mouse. Machine learning, ROC curve analysis and in vivo validation identified CSS ameliorates PD by inhibiting ferroptosis through PPARα activation. Intriguingly, CSS exhibited therapeutic potential by counteracting ferroptosis-triggered PD-like pathological manifestations in mice. Integrated analysis involving UPLC-MS/MS, druggability screening, molecular docking and MD simulations demonstrated LIQ to be a core bioactive compound in CSS. Mechanistic studies revealed that LIQ protects against MPP(+)- or erastin-induced ferroptosis in MES23.5 cells via activation of the PPARα/SCD1/FADS2 pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of PPARα abolished LIQ&#x27;s protective effects against both ferroptosis and PD progression, definitively establishing PPARα activation as essential for LIQ-mediated neuroprotection. CONCLUSION: LIQ, a major bioactive component of CSS, ameliorates PD pathology by inhibiting ferroptosis through activation of the PPARα/SCD1/FADS2 signaling pathway. These findings uncover a novel anti-ferroptosis mechanism and provide a promising therapeutic framework for the prevention and treatment of PD.	Phytomedicine	15/09/2025
10.1016/j.ejca.2025.115789	(177)Lu-PSMA vs. cabazitaxel in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer: Real-world efficacy and safety data from the ARON-3 study.

However, multicenter real-world data on cancer-control outcomes are scant. METHODS: Real-word data from the ARON-3 collaboration in progressive mCRPC patients treated with (177)Lu-PSMA vs. cabazitaxel were collected. A retrospective analysis was performed, including overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), time to treatment failure (TTF) and PSA50/90 rates. RESULTS: Data from 285 (50.1 %) patients receiving (177)Lu-PSMA vs. 283 (49.9 %) cabazitaxel after one or two lines of ARPI and Docetaxel were analyzed. PSA50 and PSA90 rates were higher, and TTF and OS were significantly longer in (177)Lu-PSMA patients, even after multivariable adjustment (p ≤ 0.01). This effect held true for most subgroups such as age &lt; 70 and ≥ 70 years, ECOG 0-1, distant lymph nodes and one vs. two lines of prior ARPI. Incidence of grade 3-4 adverse events were comparable between both treatments (37 % vs. 43 % for (177)Lu-PSMA vs. cabazitaxel cohort p = 0.5) but differed according to the type of adverse events. Sensitivity analyses with cross-over adjustment showed similar effects. CONCLUSIONS: Analyzing the currently largest real-world cohort comparing (177)Lu-PSMA vs. cabazitaxel, we provided robust information of (177)Lu-PSMA being at least equally effective or possibly even superior to cabazitaxel regarding cancer-control outcomes with reasonable side effects.

10.3389/fnut.2025.1642913	Advanced lung cancer inflammation index as a new predictor for colon cancer in elderly patients: an NHANES-based study.	Zhong H; Chen Y; Wu W; Liu S; Fan Y; Liu H; Lin R; Wan J; He M	BACKGROUND: Nutritional and inflammatory status have both been implicated in colon cancer risk. The advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI) is a composite prognostic index that incorporates body mass index (BMI), serum albumin, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), reflecting both nutritional and systemic inflammatory states. However, its role in predicting colon cancer prevalence in elderly individuals remains unclear. METHODS: We used the ALI as a composite marker reflecting both inflammation status and nutritional health. The ALI is calculated as BMI × serum albumin/NLR, where higher values indicate better nutritional status and lower systemic inflammation. To evaluate the association between ALI and colon cancer prevalence, we conducted multivariate logistic regression, applied an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning model, and performed subgroup analyses. Additionally, a smoothed two-piece logistic regression model was used to identify the ALI threshold predictive of colon cancer. RESULTS: The study included 10,137 elderly participants, with a colon cancer prevalence of 2.45%. The ALI was significantly lower in the colon cancer group compared to those without (p &lt; 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression revealed a significant inverse association between ALI and colon cancer (p &lt; 0.05), with individuals in the highest ALI tertile experiencing a 67% lower risk compared to those in the lowest tertile (p for trend = 0.008). Generalized additive models showed a linear relationship, identifying an inflection point at 4.73 and a predictive threshold of 113.3. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings, particularly among individuals aged over 70 years, females, unmarried individuals, alcohol consumers, and those with a BMI below 30. In the XGBoost model, ALI demonstrated the highest predictive value for colon cancer (AUC = 0.717), outperforming traditional demographic and clinical variables such as age and BMI. Furthermore, ALI showed a positive association with dietary health status (p &lt; 0.05) but was not significantly related to bowel habits. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that ALI, a nutritional-inflammation prognostic index, is significantly and inversely associated with the risk of colon cancer in older adults. Thus, ALI may serve as a promising, non-invasive biomarker for risk stratification, particularly among high-risk subgroups such as unmarried females, alcohol consumers, and those with lower BMI. Its strong predictive value, confirmed by machine learning, supports its potential role in personalized prevention. Further studies are required to explore underlying mechanisms, including dietary and microbial factors.	Front Nutr	01/01/2025
10.1186/s40779-025-00649-5	Are metformin-based combination approaches beneficial for non-small cell lung cancer: evidence from experimental and clinical studies.	Thyagarajan A; Gajjar V; Sahu RP	Despite having multiple treatment options, the overall outcomes, including the survival rates of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, remain relatively low, indicating the need to explore new approaches to achieve improved therapeutic responses. To that end, repurposed drugs such as metformin have been evaluated against many cancer types, including NSCLC. Metformin, a widely used oral hypoglycemic drug for type 2 diabetes, exhibits anticancer properties and synergy with several standards of care agents. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the role and anticancer mechanisms of metformin-based combination approaches for the treatment of NSCLC. We logically discussed the experimental evidence from the in vitro and in vivo studies utilizing metformin alone, and then its combination with chemotherapeutic agents, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. We also present clinical trials that underscore the beneficial and adverse outcomes of metformin use in combination with targeted therapy and chemotherapeutic agents, and emphasize the limitations and challenges for the treatment of diabetic and non-diabetic NSCLC patients. It appears that, regardless of the diverse anticancer mechanisms of this biguanide, the benefits may be confined to a specific patient subgroup, which opens new avenues to be explored for NSCLC treatment.

10.1186/s12974-025-03539-8	Inhibition of Ephrin receptor signaling in the paraventricular nucleus attenuates psoriasis-like dermatitis via synaptic plasticity and immune homeostasis modulation.	Ren Q; Gao Z; Han W; Tang Y; Shi M; Yue Y; Xin X; Zhang C; Liu E; Dong B; Yue Q; Sun J	Psoriasis pathophysiology involves dysregulated neuroimmune crosstalk, yet the central mechanisms involved remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) orchestrates cutaneous inflammation via a transsynaptic brain-skin circuit. Using neural tracing and chemogenetic approaches, we revealed functional connectivity between the PVN and both sympathetic neurons and psoriatic skin. Reactivation of imiquimod (IMQ)-induced PVN-transgenic targeted recombination in active population (TRAP) neurons (which form a specific &quot;inflammatory memory&quot;) is essential for psoriasis progression and can drive chronic inflammation. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) identified ephrin receptor A7 (Epha7) as a critical mediator of synaptic plasticity in PVN inflammatory engram neurons. The inhibition of Ephrin receptor and ligand binding in the PVN normalized dendritic spine remodelling, suppressed sympathetic nerve hyperactivity, and restored the balance of Th17/Treg cells in psoriatic-like mice. Mechanistically, blockade of the Ephrin receptor attenuated sympathetic norepinephrine overflow, thereby mitigating Th17-driven inflammation. This study identifies a PVN-sympathetic-skin axis in which the inhibition of Epha7 in the PVN restores skin immune homeostasis. Furthermore, this study elucidates the central neural mechanisms of skin inflammation and promotes the transition of psoriasis treatment from single-target approaches to a synergistic neuroimmune strategy involving &quot;brain-skin&quot; interactions.

10.1177/00333549231218277	Hepatitis B Care Continuum Models-Data to Inform Public Health Action.	Spradling PR; Bocour A; Kuncio DE; Ly KN; Harris AM; Thompson ND	The application of a care continuum model (CCM) can identify gaps in diagnosis, care, and treatment of populations with a common condition, but challenges are inherent in developing a CCM for chronic hepatitis B. In contrast with treatment for HIV or hepatitis C, treatment is not indicated for all people with chronic hepatitis B, clinical endpoints are not clear for those receiving treatment, and those for whom treatment is not indicated remain at risk for complications. This topical review examines the data elements necessary to develop and apply chronic hepatitis B CCMs at the jurisdictional health department level. We conducted a nonsystematic review of US-based publications in Ovid MEDLINE (1946-present), Ovid Embase (1974-present), and Scopus (not date limited) databases, which yielded 724 publications for review. Jurisdictional health departments, if properly supported, could develop locale-specific focused CCMs using person-level chronic hepatitis B registries, updated longitudinally using electronic laboratory reporting data and case reporting data. These CCMs could be applied to identify disparities and improve rates in testing and access to care and treatment, which are necessary to reduce liver disease and chronic hepatitis B mortality. Investments in public health surveillance infrastructure, including substantial enhancements in electronic laboratory reporting and case reporting and the use of supplementary data sources, could enable jurisdictional health departments to develop modified CCMs for chronic hepatitis B that focus, at least initially, on &quot;early&quot; CCM steps, which emphasize optimization of hepatitis B diagnosis, linkage to care, and ongoing clinical follow-up of diagnosed people, all of which can lead to improved outcomes.

10.1136/jitc-2024-010812	Autophagy inhibition improves the efficacy of anlotinib and PD-1 inhibitors in the treatment of NSCLC.	Tang H; You T; Ge H; Bai C; Wang Y; Sun Z; Han Q; Zhao RC	BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are major non-tumor cellular components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and are closely related to immune suppression. The enhancement of anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) efficacy by antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors (TKIs) is partly due to the elimination of CAFs, which improves the immunosuppressive microenvironment. However, it remains unclear whether antiangiogenic TKIs regulate the autophagy of CAFs, thereby affecting the immunotherapy response. METHODS: We first examined the effects of autophagy inhibition and anlotinib on the TME and immunotherapy response via animal experiments. Then, CAF models were established in vitro. The effects and mechanisms of autophagy inhibition on the efficacy of anlotinib and CAFs were further explored in vitro. To specifically validate the role of CAF autophagy, we additionally constructed LLC tumor-bearing mouse models co-implanted with CAFs transfected with ATG5-targeting siRNA or non-targeting control siRNA. RESULTS: In anti-PD-1-resistant (LLC) and CAF-rich (LA795+MSC) non-small cell lung cancer models, the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine significantly enhanced anlotinib+anti-PD-1 efficacy-likely by inducing more apoptosis of CAFs and M2 macrophages, reshaping the TME to promote CD8+T cell infiltration. After ATG5 knockdown (autophagy inhibition) in CAFs, the efficacy-enhancing effect of anti-PD-1 therapy was significantly attenuated versus control, confirming CAF autophagy is core to TME regulation. In vitro, anlotinib induced CAF autophagy via AKT/mTOR inhibition; inhibiting CAF autophagy enhanced anlotinib-induced CAF apoptosis and impaired CAFs&#x27; ability to recruit M2 macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: Autophagy inhibition enhances the effects of antiangiogenic TKIs on tumor cells and CAFs and directly or indirectly regulates the TME, which might explain why autophagy inhibition enhances the efficacy of antiangiogenic TKIs combined with anti-PD-1 therapy.

10.1172/JCI180927	USP10/GSK3B-mediated inhibition of PTEN drives resistance to PI3K inhibitors in breast cancer.	Kumari N; Wright SC; Witham CM; Monserrat L; Palafox M; Charles Richard JL; Costa C; Elkabets M; Agostino M; Klemm T; Eccles MK; Garnham A; Wu T; Nilsson JA; Walz N; Venugopal V; Cerra A; Vasilevski N; Bridgeman SC; Bassi S; Saei A; Helal M; Neundorf P; Riedel A; Rosenfeldt M; Gill J; Pahor N; Hartmann O; Chung J; Sidhu SS; Moderau N; Jha S; Rodon J; Diefenbacher ME; Komander D; Serra V; Eichhorn P	Activating mutations in PIK3CA, the gene encoding the catalytic p110-alpha subunit of PI3K, are some of the most frequent genomic alterations in breast cancer. Alpelisib, a small-molecule inhibitor that targets p110-alpha, is a recommended drug for patients with PIK3CA-mutant advanced breast cancer. However, clinical success for PI3K inhibitors has been limited by their narrow therapeutic window. The lipid phosphatase PTEN is a potent tumour suppressor and a major negative regulator of the PI3K pathway. Unsurprisingly, inactivating mutations in PTEN correlate with tumour progression and resistance to PI3K inhibition due to persistent PI3K signalling. Here we demonstrate that PI3K inhibition leads rapidly to the inactivation of PTEN. Using a functional genetic screen we show that this effect is mediated by a USP10-GSK3-B signalling axis, in which USP10 stabilizes GSK3-B resulting in GSK3-B-mediated phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of PTEN. This phosphorylation inhibits PTEN dimerization and thus prevents its activation. Downregulation of GSK3-B or USP10 re-sensitizes PI3K inhibitor resistant breast cancer models and patient derived organoids to PI3K inhibition and induces tumour regression.

10.1542/peds.2016-3840	Prenatal Exposure to Acetaminophen and Risk of ADHD.	Ystrom E; Gustavson K; Brandlistuen RE; Knudsen GP; Magnus P; Susser E; Davey Smith G; Stoltenberg C; Surén P; Håberg SE; Hornig M; Lipkin WI; Nordeng H; Reichborn-Kjennerud T	OBJECTIVES: To estimate the association between maternal use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and of paternal use before pregnancy with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in offspring while adjusting for familial risk for ADHD and indications of acetaminophen use. METHODS: Diagnoses were obtained from the Norwegian Patient Registry for 112 973 offspring from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, including 2246 with ADHD. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for an ADHD diagnosis by using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: After adjusting for maternal use of acetaminophen before pregnancy, familial risk for ADHD, and indications of acetaminophen use, we observed a modest association between any prenatal maternal use of acetaminophen in 1 (HR = 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96-1.19), 2 (HR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.07-1.38), and 3 trimesters (HR = 1.27; 95% CI 0.99-1.63). The HR for more than 29 days of maternal acetaminophen use was 2.20 (95% CI 1.50-3.24). Use for &lt;8 days was negatively associated with ADHD (HR = 0.90; 95% CI 0.81-1.00). Acetaminophen use for fever and infections for 22 to 28 days was associated with ADHD (HR = 6.15; 95% CI 1.71-22.05). Paternal and maternal use of acetaminophen were similarly associated with ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term maternal use of acetaminophen during pregnancy was negatively associated with ADHD in offspring. Long-term maternal use of acetaminophen during pregnancy was substantially associated with ADHD even after adjusting for indications of use, familial risk of ADHD, and other potential confounders.

10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.32650	Efficacy and Safety of Ammoxetine in Major Depressive Disorder: A Randomized Clinical Trial.	He S; Chen JX; Yu X; Lin H; Wang Z; Li X; Zhou Y; Liu YS; Zhang H; Wang J; An C; Liu H; Li C; Ni S; Li H	IMPORTANCE: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is among the most prevalent mental health disorders, causing substantial disability and economic burden. Although several first-line treatments exist with mild adverse effects, up to 50% to 60% of patients do not tolerate or respond to them. Ammoxetine, a novel selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, has been found to reduce adverse effects and hepatotoxicity and more potent inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine transporters, making it more tolerable and effective. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ammoxetine in treating adults with MDD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This phase 2 randomized clinical trial was a multicenter, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study of ammoxetine treatment in patients with MDD in China. Patients aged 18 to 65 years from 15 study centers were randomized into daily ammoxetine or placebo groups between March 27, 2023, and June 13, 2024, and followed up for 10 weeks. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized 1:1:1 to 3 treatment groups: ammoxetine 40 mg/d, ammoxetine 60 mg/d, and placebo. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from baseline to 8 weeks. Efficacy analyses were performed on both the full-analysis and per-protocol sets using least-squares (LS) mean differences. The safety set analysis was performed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Among 239 enrolled patients (mean [SD] age, 30.4 [10.0] years, 158 female [66.1%]), 80 were randomized to the ammoxetine 60 mg/d group, 80 to the ammoxetine 40 mg/d group, and 79 to the placebo group. In the full-analysis set, both ammoxetine doses led to statistically significant improvements in MADRS total scores at week 8 compared with placebo. The LS mean changes (SE) from baseline were -16.7 (1.3) for ammoxetine 40 mg/d, -16.6 (1.3) for ammoxetine 60 mg/d, and -13.5 (1.3) for placebo. The differences vs placebo were -3.3 (97.3 CI, -6.3 to -0.3) for ammoxetine 40 mg/d and -3.1 (97.3% CI, -6.2 to 0.0) for ammoxetine 60 mg/d. Consistent results were observed in the per-protocol set analysis at week 8 for ammoxetine 40 mg/d (LS mean change, -3.2; 97.3% CI, -6.2 to -0.2) and ammoxetine 60 mg/d (LS mean change, -3.18; 97.3% CI, -6.2 to -0.2), both superior to placebo. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 68 participants (85.0%) receiving ammoxetine 60 mg/d, 63 (78.8%) receiving ammoxetine 40 mg/d, and 48 (60.8%) receiving placebo; most were mild to moderate in severity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial demonstrated superiority over placebo of ammoxetine treatment at both 40 mg/d and 60 mg/d in patients with MDD. In addition, all doses of ammoxetine were generally well tolerated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05762458.	JAMA Netw Open	02/09/2025
10.1021/jacs.5c07917	Marine Natural Product Chagosendine C Induces Cuproptosis in Colorectal Cancer Cells by Targeting FDX1.	Tao X; Wang H; Wang Q; Wang C; Shao CW; Jin Y; Yu D; Hu H; Zhang Q; Xu M; Geng X; Xu H; Li L; Shen R; Guo YW; Li XW; Liu S; Zhang W	Colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment is hampered by high recurrence rates and drug resistance. Cuproptosis, a copper-induced cell death mechanism, offers a new therapeutic approach. Here, we identified a marine natural product, chagosendine C (CHC), which kills tumor cells by increasing the intracellular copper ion concentration. CHC and related metal coordination homodimer alkaloids were rapidly synthesized and purified for further pharmacological study. In vitro, CHC significantly inhibited HCT116 and RKO CRC cell growth, induced G1 phase arrest and cell death, and overcame oxaliplatin resistance. In vivo, CHC suppressed colorectal tumor growth in mice at 40 mg/kg without obvious toxic effects. Mechanistically, CHC induces cuproptosis by targeting FDX1, increasing intracellular copper ions and ROS levels in tumor cells, and leading to cell death. Thus, CHC presents a novel CRC treatment strategy, showing strong antitumor activity and potential to overcome oxaliplatin resistance with promising clinical prospects.	J Am Chem Soc	22/09/2025
10.1177/12034754251368849	A Canadian Consensus on Androgenetic Alopecia: Approach and Management.	Landells I; Chow E; Gupta AK; Jasso Olivares JC; Thuraisingam T; Ahluwalia R; Tan JKL; Pratt M; Yadav G; Chivers Q; Vezina N; Laforest T; Raad E; Owen J; Dayeh NR	Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is the most common hair loss condition affecting between 40% to 50% of Canadian men and women by 50 years of age. This nonscarring hereditary condition can significantly affect patients, impacting their overall well-being and quality of life. Despite the multitude of interventions and the willingness of people with AGA to try treatments, there are no clear Canadian guidelines on its management. An expert panel of 11 physicians developed Delphi-based consensus recommendations of interventions for the management of AGA in male and female adults. Forty-five interventions were reviewed. Seven interventions are recommended, including oral dutasteride; oral finasteride; topical finasteride; topical minoxidil; platelet-rich plasma; microneedling; and oral minoxidil. Five interventions are recommended with near consensus: intralesional dutasteride; ketoconazole shampoo; low level laser therapy; aminexil; as part of a regimen and 17 are not recommended (adenosine; cetirizine; carboxytherapy; amla syrup; microfilament thread; Nourkrin; injectable minoxidil; caffeine; ceramide; topical herbal formulations; piroctone olamine shampoo or leave-on; rosemary oil; shampoo and lotion hair care products containing fermented papaya, fermented mangosteen, and caffeine; basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF); flutamide).

10.26603/001c.38017	Relationships between Running Biomechanics, Hip Muscle Strength, and Running-Related Injury in Female Collegiate Cross-country Runners.	Venable EN; Seynaeve LA; Beale ST; Gamez A Jr; Domingo A; Rosenthal MD; Rauh MJ	BACKGROUND: Female collegiate cross-country (XC) runners have a high incidence of running-related injury (RRI). Limited reports are available that have examined potential intrinsic factors that may increase RRI risk in this population. PURPOSE: To examine the relationships between RRI, hip muscle strength, and lower extremity running kinematics in female collegiate XC runners. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort. METHODS: Participants included twenty female NCAA collegiate XC runners from Southern California universities who competed in the 2019-20 intercollegiate season. A pre-season questionnaire was used to gather demographic information. Hip muscle strength was measured with isokinetic dynamometry in a sidelying open-chain position and normalized by the runner&#x27;s body weight (kg). Running kinematic variables were examined using Qualisys 3D Motion Capture and Visual 3D analysis. RRI occurrence was obtained via post-season questionnaires. Independent t-tests were used to determine mean differences between injured and non-injured runners for hip abductor muscle strength and selected running kinematics. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to examine relationships between hip muscle performance and kinematic variables. RESULTS: End-of-the-season RRI information was gathered from 19 of the 20 participants. During the 2019-20 XC season, 57.9% (11 of 19) of the runners sustained an RRI. There were no significant differences between mean hip abductor normalized muscle strength (p=0.76) or mean normalized hip muscle strength asymmetry (p=0.18) of injured and non-injured runners during the XC season. Similarly, no significant differences were found between mean values of selected kinematic variables of runners who did and who did not report an RRI. Moderate relationships were found between hip abductor strength variables and right knee adduction at footstrike (r=0.50), maximum right knee adduction during stance (r=0.55), left supination at footstrike (r=0.48), right peak pronation during stance (r=-0.47), left supination at footstrike (r=0.51), and right peak pronation during stance (r=-0.54) (all p≤0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Hip abduction muscle strength, hip abduction strength asymmetry, and selected running kinematic variables were not associated with elevated risk of RRI in female collegiate XC runners.

10.1016/S1474-4422(25)00304-7	2024 MAGNIMS-CMSC-NAIMS consensus recommendations on the use of MRI for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.	Barkhof F; Reich DS; Oh J; Rocca MA; Li DKB; Sati P; Azevedo CJ; Bagnato F; Calabresi PA; Ciccarelli O; Dwyer MG; DeLuca GC; De Stefano N; Enzinger C; Filippi M; Granziera C; Halper J; Henry RG; Gasperini C; Gauthier S; Kappos L; Laule C; Newsome SD; Montalban X; Morrow SA; Schoonheim MM; Sicotte N; Toosy A; Wilken J; Yousry T; Sastre-Garriga J; Traboulsee A; Ontaneda D; Rovira À	MRI plays an increasingly important role in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. We discuss the expanded role of MRI in the 2024 McDonald diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis, which include the optic nerve as a fifth anatomical location, in addition to the periventricular, juxtacortical or cortical, infratentorial, and spinal cord regions. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis can now be confirmed when the criteria of dissemination in space are fulfilled with the detection of typical lesions in at least four locations without additional evidence. We recommend appropriate imaging strategies and MRI acquisition protocols for all aspects of multiple sclerosis diagnosis, including fat-saturated sequences for detection of symptomatic optic nerve lesions. Diagnostic imaging should always cover the brain and spinal cord and include susceptibility-sensitive sequences for the assessment of the central vein sign and paramagnetic rim lesions, which can be especially helpful in cases when conventional imaging findings are insufficient to establish a diagnosis. We discuss how to handle the diagnosis of radiologically isolated presentations of multiple sclerosis, which are included in the 2024 criteria. We present recommendations for image interpretation and avoidance of misdiagnosis, and extend the recommendations to the use of MRI in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in older people, children, people with vascular comorbidities or migraine, and people living outside Europe and North America. Finally, we provide recommendations for standardisation of MRI acquisition and communication of results to enable an earlier diagnosis while maintaining high diagnostic specificity.

10.1097/IJG.0000000000001167	Comparison of Fellow Eyes of Acute Primary Angle Closure and Phacomorphic Angle Closure.	Moghimi S; Fathollahzadeh N; Chen R; Lin SC; Weinreb RN	PURPOSE: To compare anterior segment parameters in fellow eyes of acute primary angle closure (APAC) and fellow eyes of phacomorphic angle closure (AC) and to identify parameters that could be used to differentiate fellow eyes of the 2 entities. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 55 unaffected fellow eyes of APAC, 48 unaffected fellow eyes of phacomorphic AC, and 52 eyes of control subjects. All patients underwent anterior segment optical coherence tomography imaging. Anterior chamber depth, anterior chamber area, anterior chamber width (ACW), iris thickness (IT), iris curvature, lens vault (LV), and angle parameters including angle-opening distance (AOD750) were measured in qualified images using customized software and compared among the groups using a linear mixed model. RESULTS: Fellow eyes of APAC had the smallest axial length, AOD, anterior chamber depth, anterior chamber area, ACW, and the greatest LV, and IT (P≤0.002 for all), followed by fellow eyes of phacomorphic AC, after adjustment for age, sex, and pupil diameter. IT and curvature were comparable between fellow eyes of phacomorphic AC and controls. Angle parameters had the highest area of the receiver-operator characteristic curve for discrimination of fellow eyes of APAC eyes and phacomorphic AC (0.795, P=0.001 for AOD750). In a multivariable analysis, AOD750&lt;0.161 µm [odds ratio (OR), 23.43; P=0.001], LV&gt;768.6 µm (OR, 16.76; P=0.001), ACW&lt;11.07 mm (OR, 8.93; P=0.023) and younger age (P=0.001) were the factors that discriminated fellow eyes of APAC from phacomorphic AC. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in ocular biometric parameters can be detected between fellow eyes of APAC and phacomorphic AC. Narrower angle, more anteriorly displaced lens, and thicker iris are the main parameters that distinguish fellow eyes of APAC and phacomorphic AC.	J Glaucoma	01/03/2019
10.1097/JS9.0000000000003552	Deciphering pathogenic mechanisms of BDCPP Exposure in endometrial cancer progression via an integrated approach combining network toxicology, machine learning, and molecular docking.	Wang Z; Fu Y; Cai Q; Zong L	BACKGROUND: Endometrial cancer (EC) is one of the most common gynecological malignancies globally. Increasing attention has been paid to the role of environmental pollutants in EC development. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a significant association between elevated urinary concentrations of bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCPP) and an increased risk of EC. However, the hub genes and underlying mechanisms of BDCPP-induced EC remain poorly understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Potential targets of BDCPP and EC were retrieved from multiple databases. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed based on the common targets. Enrichment analysis was performed using GO, KEGG, and Reactome databases. Clinical and transcriptomic data of EC patients were downloaded from TCGA. Subsequently, 117 machine learning models were employed to screen for hub genes. A risk score for BDCPP exposure was calculated based on the hub genes. Single-gene gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted on the hub genes and molecular docking was performed to predict the binding affinity of BDCPP to the hub genes. RESULTS: We identified 165 potential targets implicated in BDCPP-induced EC. Machine learning pinpointed eight hub genes: PLA2G2A, PLAU, SIRT2, DRD2, GSK3A, THRB, CYP17A1 , and TLR9 . The BDCPP exposure risk score model offers a framework for predicting the prognosis of EC patients with moderate accuracy. Molecular docking revealed the binding potential between BDCPP and hub genes. Our findings highlight the pivotal roles of inflammatory activation, hormonal disruption, altered lipid metabolism, and epigenetic dysregulation in pathogenic mechanisms. Single-gene GSEA further emphasized the critical roles of nucleocytoplasmic transport, polycomb repressive complex, and mRNA surveillance pathway in this process. CONCLUSION: Our study investigated the hub genes and underlying mechanisms of BDCPP-induced EC. The findings not only offer novel insights into the role of environmental pollutants in EC development but also present an analytical framework for elucidating the carcinogenic mechanisms of other environmental chemicals.

10.1002/advs.202506345	PPP1R3B Suppresses Atherosclerosis by Promoting the M2 Polarization of Macrophages Through Glycogen Metabolic Reprogramming.	Shen L; Yu J; Chen W; Bi Y; Yang Z; Lu C; Jiang C; Yang Y; Chen M; Zou J; Lv L; Chen X; Ji J	Identifying targets that promote M2 macrophage polarization in the hypoxic plaque microenvironment is crucial for modulating immune metabolism and optimizing energy dynamics in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) treatment. The high phagocytic activity of M2 macrophages reduces foam cell formation. Their secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines enhances plaque stability, mitigating atherosclerosis progression. Through high-throughput sequencing and multi-omics bioinformatics analysis, protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3B (PPP1R3B) is identified as a key regulator linking glycogen metabolism to macrophage polarization. The integrated approach combined transcriptomic analysis of human atherosclerotic plaques (GSE57614) with RNA-seq of PPP1R3B-modulated macrophages, revealing its dual role. PPP1R3B induces anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage polarization and maintains energy supply in plaques. Its absence accelerates plaque progression. PPP1R3B regulates M2 macrophage polarization and energy metabolism via phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3), which plays a dual role by activating anti-inflammatory transcriptional programs through the PPAR-γ/PGC-1α/CD206 axis in the nucleus and enhancing glycogenolysis-mediated metabolic activity via the p-GSK-3β/p-PYGL/p-GYS2 axis in mitochondria. STAT3 plays a dual role in metabolic regulation and macrophage phenotype modulation. By orchestrating glycogen metabolic reprogramming, PPP1R3B-induced M2 polarization presents a novel strategy for anti-ASCVD drug development, with significant potential for clinical translation.

10.3389/fimmu.2025.1620768	Increased risk of antiphospholipid syndrome in patients with psoriasis: a retrospective cohort study.	Wang Q; Cui R; Du Y; Wang YH; Wei JC; Dai SM	OBJECTIVES: Psoriasis is associated with systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation, raising concerns about its potential link to antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). However, evidence on the risk of APS in psoriasis patients remains limited. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the TriNetX US Collaborative Networks (2002-2022). Propensity score matching (1:1) was performed to balance demographic variables, comorbidities, and medication use between 288,678 psoriasis and non-psoriasis patients. The univariate Cox proportional hazard model and subgroup analyses were used to estimate the hazard ratio for APS. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to plot the cumulative incidence curves. RESULTS: After matching, each cohort included 288,678 patients. Psoriasis patients exhibited significantly higher APS incidence (1,349 cases vs. 673 in controls; HR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.56-1.88). Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) further amplified risk (HR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.58-2.31). Subgroup analyses identified elevated APS susceptibility in older adults, females, Black/African American individuals, and those with chronic comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are significant risk factors for APS, highlighting the need for targeted screening and management strategies in these populations.

10.1093/cvr/cvaf159	Oxidized LDL-induced FOXS1 mediates cholesterol transport dysfunction and inflammasome activation to drive aortic valve calcification.	Jiang C; Yao D; Shen Q; Tian R; Fan L; Zheng Q; Qian X; Liu Z; Huang Y; Dong N	AIMS: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is becoming more prevalent with the population ageing; however, there is currently no medical therapy available. During early lipid deposition, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) mediates chronic inflammation and accelerates calcification progression. However, the mechanism still needs to be further explored. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study identified the transcription factor FOXS in human valvular interstitial cells (VICs) as a pivotal regulator in aortic valve calcification. Bulk RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analysis were conducted to establish that FOXS1 is induced by oxidized LDL (oxLDL) in VICs. To elucidate the role of FOXS1 in osteogenic differentiation, small interfering RNA and recombinant adenovirus were utilized to modulate FOXS1 expression in VICs. High-fat diet (HFD)-fed Apoe-/-Foxs1-/- mice served as an in vivo model to investigate the role of FOXS1 in aortic valve calcification. Analysis from bulk RNA-seq, qRT-PCR, and western blot indicated significant activation of FOXS1 by oxLDL in VICs, with silencing of FOXS1 inhibiting oxLDL-induced osteogenic differentiation. Deletion of FOXS1 markedly reduced aortic valve calcification in HFD-fed Apoe-/- mice, as shown by decreased calcium deposition in the aortic valve leaflets. RNA-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing were performed to reveal the regulatory mechanisms of FOXS1, uncovering direct interactions with the promoter of BSCL2, which subsequently inhibits the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 via the PPARγ/LXRα axis. The study demonstrated that FOXS1 mediates VICs&#x27; cholesterol transport dysfunction through BSCL2, ABCA1, and ABCG1 using Bodipy-cholesterol and showed that intracellular cholesterol accumulation can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, promoting osteogenic differentiation of VICs. Additionally, it was found that IMM-H007 and recombinant BSCL2 could reduce aortic valve calcification both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: We identified that an oxLDL-induced transcription factor FOXS1 inhibits ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression via the BSCL2/PPARγ/LXRα axis and promotes cholesterol transport dysfunction and the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in VICs, thereby accelerating the progression of CAVD.

Here, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of icotrokinra (JNJ-77242113), a targeted oral peptide that selectively binds the interleukin-23 receptor, compared with both placebo and deucravacitinib in adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. METHODS: The phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-comparator-controlled ICONIC-ADVANCE 1 and ICONIC-ADVANCE 2 trials, which are being done at 149 sites across 13 countries and 114 sites across 11 countries, respectively, randomly assigned (2:1:2 and 4:1:4, respectively) adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis diagnosed for at least 26 weeks (body-surface-area involvement ≤10%, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI] ≤12, and Investigator&#x27;s Global Assessment [IGA] ≤3) to once-daily oral icotrokinra 200 mg, placebo, or deucravacitinib 6 mg; participants randomly assigned to placebo or deucravacitinib transitioned to icotrokinra at week 16 or week 24, respectively. Coprimary endpoints were proportions of participants achieving IGA 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear skin) with at least a two-grade improvement and at least 90% improvement in PASI (PASI 90) at week 16 with icotrokinra versus placebo. These studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT06143878 (ADVANCE 1) and NCT06220604 (ADVANCE 2), and are ongoing. FINDINGS: ICONIC-ADVANCE 1 enrolled participants from Jan 17, 2024, to May 24, 2024, and ICONIC-ADVANCE 2 enrolled participants from March 9, 2024, to June 13, 2024. Participants (ADVANCE 1: 774 of 988 patients screened; ADVANCE 2: 731 of 917 patients screened) were randomly assigned to icotrokinra (n=311 and 322), placebo (n=156 and 82), or deucravacitinib (n=307 and 327). All coprimary endpoints were met in both trials. Higher proportions of icotrokinra-treated versus placebo-treated participants achieved IGA 0 or 1 (ADVANCE 1: 213 [68%] of 311 vs 17 [11%] of 156, treatment difference 95% CI 58% [50-64]; ADVANCE 2: 227 [70%] of 322 vs seven [9%] of 82, 62% [53-69]; both p&lt;0·0001) and PASI 90 (ADVANCE 1: 171 [55%] of 311 vs six [4%] of 156, treatment difference 95% CI 51% [44-57]; ADVANCE 2: 184 [57%] of 322 vs one [1%] of 82, 56% [48-62]; both p&lt;0·0001) at week 16. Across studies, adverse event rates to week 16 were 303 (48%) of 632 and 136 (57%) of 237 with icotrokinra and placebo, respectively; the most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis (37 [6%] of 632 and 13 [5%] of 237) and upper respiratory tract infection (23 [4%] of 632 and eight [3%] of 237). To week 24, adverse event rates were lower than with icotrokinra (359 [57%] of 632) than deucravacitinib (411 [65%] of 634). INTERPRETATION: Icotrokinra showed superior clinical response rates versus placebo and deucravacitinib in phase 3 moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis trials, with similar adverse event rates to placebo. These findings suggest the potential of once-daily oral icotrokinra to provide robust efficacy and a favourable safety profile. FUNDING: Johnson &amp; Johnson.	Lancet	18/09/2025
10.1111/liv.70367	Target Trial Emulations of GLP-1 and Dual GLP-1/GIP Agonists to Reduce Major Adverse Liver Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes.	Henney AE; Riley DR; Anson M; Azmi S; Alam U; Cuthbertson DJ	BACKGROUND: Clinical trials suggest GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs) and dual glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) RAs improve metabolic dysfunction associated with steatohepatitis (MASH) in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). We aimed to compare the estimate of the relative effect of tirzepatide, semaglutide, and liraglutide in reducing the risk of major adverse liver outcomes (MALOs) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We emulated target trials based on a real-world network of electronic health records (EHRs) from over 150 million patients. Three target trials were emulated, among eligible patients with T2D who had no prior MALO diagnosis, by comparing therapy involving tirzepatide, semaglutide, and liraglutide versus DPP4 inhibitor (DPP4i) therapy. We identified the first-ever diagnosis of MALO occurring within a 2-year follow-up period and compared across the treatment groups using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Cohorts underwent propensity score matching 1:1 for confounders. We performed sensitivity analyses relating to geographical location, combination with metformin, and by treatment adherence. We also performed head-to-head analyses of the incretin-based therapies. RESULTS: After matching, we identified three target trials comprised of 10 165, 56 702, and 8 301 patients treated with tirzepatide, semaglutide, and liraglutide, respectively (1:1 with reference patients) for a 2-year period. Tirzepatide (HR 0.53 [95% CI 0.40, 0.71]) and semaglutide (HR 0.81 [0.72, 0.90]) were associated with a significant reduction in the risk of incident MALO compared with DPP4i, whereas liraglutide was not (HR 1.04 [95% CI 0.79, 1.36]). In head-to-head comparisons, tirzepatide was associated with a significantly lower risk of incident MALO compared with liraglutide (HR 0.56 [95% CI 0.39, 0.79]), but not semaglutide (HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.63, 1.09]). Semaglutide was not associated with a reduced risk compared with liraglutide (HR 0.77 [95% CI 0.57, 1.05]). CONCLUSION: Treatment with tirzepatide and, to a lesser extent, semaglutide, in patients with T2D, was associated with a lower incidence of MALO compared with DPP4i after 2 years; largely driven by a reduction in the rates of compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. A reduction in MALO was not demonstrated with the use of liraglutide. These findings highlight a comparative benefit of tirzepatide (and semaglutide) versus DPP4i and should prompt more robust, longer-term randomised controlled studies to evaluate their role in preventing MALO in this increasingly prevalent patient population with co-existing T2D and MASLD.

10.1038/s41588-025-02321-z	Rapid epigenomic classification of acute leukemia.	Steinicke TL; Benfatto S; Capilla-Guerra MR; Monteleone AB; Young JH; Shankar S; Michaels PD; Tsai HK; Good JD; Kreso A; van Galen P; Schliemann C; Chen EC; Griffin GK; Hovestadt V	Acute leukemia requires precise molecular classification and urgent treatment. However, standard-of-care diagnostic tests are time-intensive and do not capture the full spectrum of acute leukemia heterogeneity. Here, we developed a framework to classify acute leukemia using genome-wide DNA methylation profiling. We first assembled a comprehensive reference cohort (n = 2,540 samples) and defined 38 methylation classes. Methylation-based classification matched standard-pathology lineage classification in most cases and revealed heterogeneity in addition to that captured by genetic categories. Using this reference, we developed a neural network (MARLIN; methylation- and AI-guided rapid leukemia subtype inference) for acute leukemia classification from sparse DNA methylation profiles. In retrospective cohorts profiled by nanopore sequencing, high-confidence predictions were concordant with conventional diagnoses in 25 out of 26 cases. Real-time MARLIN classification in patients with suspected acute leukemia provided accurate predictions in five out of five cases, which were typically generated within 2 h of sample receipt. In summary, we present a framework for rapid acute leukemia classification that complements and enhances standard-of-care diagnostics.	Nat Genet	22/09/2025
10.1177/22799036221110020	Health and health inequalities impact assessment for non-clinical measures to control COVID-19 in the Basque Country and Navarre (Spain).	Urtaran-Laresgoiti M; González-Rábago Y; Martín U; Rivadeneyra-Sicilia A; Morteruel M	This article describes the results of a health and health inequalities impact assessment of the COVID-19 pandemic control measures in the regions of the Basque Country and Navarre in Spain. A literature review was conducted on Pubmed and Web of Science (WoS) databases, in addition to individual semi-structured interviews and focus groups with experts, key informants and different profiles of citizens. A wide variety of social determinants of health have been affected by the measures, which included individual health-related behaviors, service disruption in formal care, educational settings, and health care provision. These changes have particularly affected certain population groups including children and adolescents, older people, those with health conditions and disabilities together with caregivers, women, as well as people with low levels of education, income, and resources. In future scenarios it will be necessary to pay attention to the potential impacts of policy responses on health inequalities to avoid an increase in existing health gaps.

10.1519/JSC.0000000000001019	Time Course of Resistance Training-Induced Muscle Hypertrophy in the Elderly.	Lixandrão ME; Damas F; Chacon-Mikahil MP; Cavaglieri CR; Ugrinowitsch C; Bottaro M; Vechin FC; Conceição MS; Berton R; Libardi CA	Extended periods of resistance training (RT) induce muscle hypertrophy. Nevertheless, to date, no study has investigated the time window necessary to observe significant changes in muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) in older adults. Therefore, this study investigated the time course of muscle hypertrophy after 10 weeks (20 sessions) of RT in the elderly. Fourteen healthy older subjects were randomly allocated in either the RT (n: 6) or control group (n: 8). The RT was composed of 4 sets × 10 repetitions (70-80% 1 repetition maximum [1RM]) in a leg press machine. The time course of vastus lateralis muscle hypertrophy (CSA) was assessed on a weekly basis by mode-B ultrasonography. Leg press muscle strength was assessed by dynamic 1RM test. Our results demonstrated that the RT group increased leg press 1RM by 42% (p ≤ 0.05) after 10 weeks of training. Significant increases in vastus lateralis muscle CSA were observed only after 18 sessions of training (9 weeks; p ≤ 0.05; 7.1%). In conclusion, our training protocol promoted muscle mass accrual in older subjects, and this was only observable after 18 sessions of RT (9 weeks).	J Strength Cond Res	01/01/2016

Yang Z; Zhang S; Faqeer A; Anjum S; Deng Y; Cao J; Yu T; Zhang Y	Temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJOA) is a common degenerative oral disease and remains one of the most challenging joint disorders to treat clinically. It is characterized by excessive subchondral bone loss at an early stage and cartilage damage at a later stage. In recent years, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) have attracted widespread attention for their potential role in modulating OA pathology. However, the application of MSC-EVs in TMJOA remains underexplored, and the mechanisms underlying their therapeutic effects are not fully understood. In this study, we evaluate the therapeutic effects of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (hUCMSC-EVs) on TMJOA, with a focus on subchondral bone, and investigate their underlying molecular mechanisms through miRNA sequencing. The results demonstrated that hUCMSC-EVs treatment significantly reduced osteoclast (OC) activity by transferring let-7a-5p, which further suppressed the expression of integrin β3 (ITGβ3) of osteoclasts. In a rat TMJOA model, intra-articular injection of hUCMSC-EVs demonstrated protective effects on both subchondral bone and cartilage, primarily through the suppression of osteoclast activity. Consequently, these results highlight the potential of hUCMSC-EV-based therapies as promising and effective approaches for the treatment of TMJOA.	ACS Nano	22/09/2025

Zhang J; Humphreys IR; Pei J; Kim J; Choi C; Yuan R; Durham J; Liu S; Choi HJ; Baek M; Baker D; Cong Q	Protein-protein interactions (PPI) are essential for biological function. Coevolutionary analysis and deep learning (DL) based protein structure prediction have enabled comprehensive PPI identification in bacteria and yeast, but these approaches have had limited success for the more complex human proteome. We overcame this challenge by enhancing the coevolutionary signals with 7-fold deeper multiple sequence alignments harvested from 30 petabytes of unassembled genomic data and developing a new DL network trained on augmented datasets of domain-domain interactions from 200 million predicted protein structures. We systematically screened 200 million human protein pairs and predicted 17,849 interactions with an expected precision of 90%, of which 3,631 interactions were not identified in previous experimental screens. Three-dimensional models of these predicted interactions provide numerous hypotheses about protein function and mechanisms of human diseases.	Science	25/09/2025
10.1001/jamaoncol.2025.3700	Ribociclib Plus Endocrine Therapy in Hormone Receptor-Positive/ERBB2-Negative Early Breast Cancer: 4-Year Outcomes From the NATALEE Randomized Clinical Trial.	Fasching PA; Stroyakovskiy D; Yardley DA; Huang CS; Crown J; Bardia A; Chia S; Im SA; Martin M; Xu B; Loi S; Barrios C; Untch M; Moroose R; Visco F; Hortobagyi GN; Slamon DJ; Fresco R; Zarate JP; Li Z; Waters S; Hurvitz SA	IMPORTANCE: Ribociclib plus a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) has demonstrated a statistically significant invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) benefit over NSAI alone in patients with hormone receptor-positive/ERBB2 (formerly HER2)-negative early breast cancer. Evaluating the efficacy and safety of adjuvant ribociclib beyond the planned 3-year treatment period is critical for understanding the long-term impact on recurrences. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and safety of adjuvant ribociclib in an exploratory 4-year analysis of the NATALEE (New Adjuvant Trial With Ribociclib [LEE011]) randomized clinical trial, with all patients no longer receiving ribociclib treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This exploratory analysis of an international, open-label, randomized phase 3 trial analyzed adjuvant treatment for premenopausal and postmenopausal women and men with hormone receptor-positive/ERBB2-negative early breast cancer. Eligible patients had anatomic stage IIA (either N0 with additional risk factors or N1 [1-3 axillary lymph nodes]), IIB, or III disease per the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual, eighth edition. The data cutoff date was April 29, 2024. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive ribociclib (400 mg once daily, days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle, over 36 months) plus NSAI (letrozole, 2.5 mg, or anastrozole, 1 mg, once daily continuously for 60 months) or NSAI alone. Men and premenopausal women also received goserelin (3.6 mg once every 28 days administered subcutaneously). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was iDFS, and secondary efficacy end points included distant disease-free survival, recurrence-free survival, and overall survival. Survival was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Among 5101 patients included in the analysis (median [range] age, 52 [24-90] years; 5081 [99.6%] female), the median follow-up for iDFS was 44.2 months (range, 0-63 months). Ribociclib plus NSAI continued to show iDFS benefit over NSAI alone (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.61-0.84), with 3-year iDFS rates of 90.8% vs 88.1% (difference, 2.7 percentage points) and 4-year rates of 88.5% vs 83.6% (difference, 4.9 percentage points). The efficacy benefit was consistent across subgroups and secondary end points. Overall survival data remain immature, although a trend in favor of ribociclib plus NSAI over NSAI alone was observed (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.64-1.07). The incidence of adverse events has remained stable. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This exploratory analysis of the NATALEE randomized clinical trial, with a median follow-up beyond the 3-year treatment duration, demonstrated consistent iDFS benefit with ribociclib plus NSAI over NSAI alone.

10.1002/advs.202509351	Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Exacerbates the Advancement of Renal Fibrosis by Modulating Renal CCR2(+)PIRB(+) Macrophages Through the ANGPTL8/PIRB/ALOX5AP Axis.	Wei S; Shou D; Huang S; Wang Y; Liu Q; Liu J; Lv X; Zeng Y; Wei L; Lin H; Chen J; Chen Y; Zhong H; Zhou Y; Ma W; Wang L; Qian G; Guo J; Sun D	Renal fibrosis is a critical pathological hallmark of chronic kidney disease. Although nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been implicated in kidney disease progression, its specific role and underlying mechanisms in renal fibrosis remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate these mechanisms by establishing a mouse model of renal fibrosis through unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) combined with a high-fat diet-induced NAFLD. Single-cell RNA sequencing, untargeted metabolomics, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence are performed, along with in vitro experiments involving primary renal macrophages and coculture models. It is demonstrated that NAFLD exacerbates renal fibrosis, as HFD-induced hepatocytes release significant levels of ANGPTL8, which activates renal CCR2(+)PIRB(+) macrophages. These specialized macrophages disrupt linoleic acid metabolism and increase the production of inflammatory cytokines, aggravating renal fibrosis. In addition, CCR2(+)PIRB(+) macrophages promote the activation and proliferation of Th17 cells, which can further contribute to the worsening of renal fibrosis. Thus, the ANGPTL8/PIRB/ALOX5AP axis is a crucial signaling pathway between the liver and kidneys, and CCR2(+)PIRB(+) macrophages play a pivotal role in the progression of NAFLD-induced renal fibrosis. These findings suggest potential therapeutic targets to treat NAFLD-related renal fibrosis.	Adv Sci (Weinh)	25/09/2025
10.2147/CPAA.S497904	Pharmacotherapy for Obesity: Recent Updates.	Fredrick TW; Camilleri M; Acosta A	In this narrative review we describe the recent updates regarding anti-obesity medications as of February 2025. We describe the physiologic mechanisms underpinning the development of hunger, satiation, and maintenance of satiety to address targets for anti-obesity medications. The efficacy, mechanism, and additional beneficial effects of anti-obesity medications are then further detailed. For this review, we focus on FDA-approved medications for obesity and on select medications currently under development and undergoing Phase 2 and 3 trials. We start by focusing on the non-incretin anti-obesity medications orlistat, phentermine, phentermine-topiramate, and naltrexone-bupropion. We also highlight setmelanotide for heritable obesity. The mechanism of action and comparative efficacy of the GLP-1 receptor agonists liraglutide and semaglutide are reviewed. Tirzepatide, the GLP-1 and GIP-receptor dual agonist is described, and weight loss is compared to alternative anti-obesity medications. Additional incretin targets in the pipeline include dual co-agonists to glucagon and GLP-1 receptors, triple agonists targeting glucagon, GLP-1 and GIP, novel GLP-1 agonists, oral formulations of GLP-1 agonists, and amylin agonists. Finally, we provide best practices for adjuncts to pharmacologic treatments of obesity, monitoring efficacy of obesity treatments, and adjusting medication regimens for providers.

10.1002/advs.202508574	Clinically Inspired Multimodal Treatment Using Induced Neural Stem Cells-Derived Exosomes Promotes Recovery of Traumatic Brain Injury through Microglial Modulation.	Li J; Xu M; Cai B; Li X; Liang Z; Xia X; Zhang H; Zhang Z; Tan F; Zheng JC	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) poses serious physical, psychosocial, and economic threats to millions of patients globally each year. While current treatment options, primarily surgery and medication, vary with TBI severity, there is no universal therapeutic agent applicable in both surgical and medical contexts. In the present study, exosomes derived from induced neural stem cells (iNSC-Exo) as a versatile therapeutic agent for TBI are investigated using a preclinical murine model. The iNSC-Exo treatment is found to exert therapeutic effects by mediating anti-neuroinflammation and neuroprotection, thereby promoting functional and cognitive recovery in TBI mice. Besides, two clinically inspired administration modalities are established for iNSC-Exo: local delivery and systemic delivery. Their efficacy is enhanced via a novel injectable hydrogel and RVG targeting for systemic delivery, respectively. Finally, the unprecedented single-cell characterization of mouse brain tissue, both pre- and post-iNSC-Exo treatment, confirms that microglia represent the predominant type of cells affected. Two microglial subpopulations (i.e., Microglia_Nrg3 and Microglia_Rarb) are identified with a reduced state of differentiation, and their connectivity with neurons is predicted through activation of the NRXN signaling pathway. Overall, these findings demonstrated that iNSC-Exo offers a versatile and potent treatment platform with clinical potential for TBI management.	Adv Sci (Weinh)	24/09/2025
10.3389/fnhum.2023.1101432	Development of running is not related to time since onset of independent walking, a longitudinal case study.	Bach MM; Zandvoort CS; Cappellini G; Ivanenko Y; Lacquaniti F; Daffertshofer A; Dominici N	INTRODUCTION: Children start to run after they master walking. How running develops, however, is largely unknown. METHODS: We assessed the maturity of running pattern in two very young, typically developing children in a longitudinal design spanning about three years. Leg and trunk 3D kinematics and electromyography collected in six recording sessions, with more than a hundred strides each, entered our analysis. We recorded walking during the first session (the session of the first independent steps of the two toddlers at the age of 11.9 and 10.6 months) and fast walking or running for the subsequent sessions. More than 100 kinematic and neuromuscular parameters were determined for each session and stride. The equivalent data of five young adults served to define mature running. After dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis based on the average pairwise correlation distance to the adult running cluster served as a measure for maturity of the running pattern. RESULTS: Both children developed running. Yet, in one of them the running pattern did not reach maturity whereas in the other it did. As expected, mature running appeared in later sessions (&gt;13 months after the onset of independent walking). Interestingly, mature running alternated with episodes of immature running within sessions. Our clustering approach separated them. DISCUSSION: An additional analysis of the accompanying muscle synergies revealed that the participant who did not reach mature running had more differences in muscle contraction when compared to adults than the other. One may speculate that this difference in muscle activity may have caused the difference in running pattern.	Front Hum Neurosci	01/01/2023
10.1681/ASN.0000000856	Bmpr2 Drives Aberrant Activation and Injury of Glomerular Endothelial Cells in Lupus Nephritis.	Qing J; Wen J; Wang X; Zhao Y; Shen X; Huang X; Wei R; Wang X; Kang M; Bai L; Zhou L; Wang X; Tong Q; Wu J	BACKGROUND: Lupus nephritis, a severe complication of systemic lupus erythematosus, is closely associated with the abnormal activation of glomerular endothelial cells. Despite its significance, the core mechanisms underlying glomerular endothelial cell activation remain elusive. METHODS: We performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on kidney tissues from lupus nephritis patients and mouse models to investigate transcriptional alterations in glomerular endothelial cells, and validated our findings in two lupus nephritis models: pristane-induced lupus nephritis and MRL/lpr mice. Genetically modified mice and cultured cells were employed to further validate the key discoveries. Additionally, a panel of cytokine stimulations was used to elucidate the underlying causes of glomerular endothelial cell injury in lupus nephritis. RESULTS: Bmpr2 was identified as a critical regulator, showing significant upregulation in glomerular endothelial cells from both lupus nephritis patients and mouse models. Elevated Bmpr2 expression correlated with enhanced glomerular endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and increased expression of adhesion molecules (Vcam1, Icam1). BMPR2 activated SMAD-dependent pathways, leading to the upregulation of downstream targets ID1 and ID3, thereby promoting glomerular endothelial cell hyperactivation. Bmpr2 overexpression amplified glomerular endothelial cell proliferation and migration, whereas inhibition of ID signaling by DMH2 or endothelial-specific Bmpr2 knockout attenuated these effects. Moreover, targeting BMPR2 signaling reduced the infiltration of CD86+ macrophages into lupus nephritis kidneys. Co-culture experiments confirmed that Bmpr2-activated glomerular endothelial cells promoted macrophage differentiation into an inflammatory phenotype. Complement component C5a was identified as a critical upstream inducer of Bmpr2 in glomerular endothelial cells, and inhibition of C5a signaling with the C5aR1 antagonist PMX-53 effectively suppressed Bmpr2 upregulation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight BMPR2 as a key regulator of glomerular endothelial cell injury and macrophage-mediated inflammation in lupus nephritis. Targeting BMPR2 or its upstream activators, such as C5a, effectively treated and improved lupus nephritis.	J Am Soc Nephrol	22/09/2025
10.1038/s41388-025-03569-9	Cancer-associated fibroblasts drive lung adenocarcinoma progression via THBS2-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition.	Ren Y; Ming R; Zuo A; Liu S; Ba Y; Zhang Y; Chen Y; Pan T; Luo P; Cheng Q; Deng J; Yue Y; Xu H; Weng S; Han X; Zhou D; Liu Z	The role of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the initiation and invasion phases of human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) development is not fully understood. In this study, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and a combination of in vivo and in vitro models to decode the dynamics of tumor-stroma interactions during human LUAD progression, focusing primarily on adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), and invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC). We identified a matrix CAF (mCAF) subtype characterized by high THBS2 expression, which was closely associated with poor clinical outcomes, tumor recurrence, and the invasive dynamics of LUAD. Spatial transcriptomics and multiplex immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that this CAF subpopulation was closely associated with tumor cells, with clear spatial colocalization. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that THBS2 secreted by these mCAFs directly binds to SDC4 on tumor cells, enhancing tumor epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) programs. This study highlights THBS2+ mCAFs as key regulators of tumor-stroma interactions and identifies the THBS2-SDC4-EMT axis as a potential therapeutic target in LUAD.	Oncogene	19/09/2025
10.1097/AOG.0000000000005802	Acetaminophen in Pregnancy and Attention-Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder and Autism Spectrum Disorder.	Damkier P; Gram EB; Ceulemans M; Panchaud A; Cleary B; Chambers C; Weber-Schoendorfer C; Kennedy D; Hodson K; Grant KS; Diav-Citrin O; Običan SG; Shechtman S; Alwan S	Acetaminophen is a common over-the-counter medication that recently gained substantial media attention regarding its use by pregnant individuals. In this clinical perspective, we discuss the strengths and limitations of the published literature on the effect of maternal acetaminophen use in pregnancy on the child&#x27;s risk of developing attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Studies included were specifically selected on the basis of the quality and validity of ADHD or ASD outcome definitions. From a total of 56 identified studies, commentaries, and editorials of relevance, we critically reviewed nine studies with original data that satisfied our inclusion criteria and three meta-analyses. Most studies that have reported positive findings are difficult to interpret because they have important biases, notably a high degree of selection bias, variability in selection and adjustment for various potential confounders, and unmeasured familial confounding. When unobserved familial confounding through sibling analysis was controlled for, associations weakened substantially. This suggests that residual confounding from shared genetic and environmental factors may have caused an upward bias in the original observations. According to the current scientific evidence, in utero exposure to acetaminophen is unlikely to confer a clinically important increased risk of childhood ADHD or ASD. The current level of evidence does not warrant changes to clinical guidelines on the treatment of fever or pain in pregnancy. Prospective research designed to account for familial and psychosocial environmental factors related to both maternal use of acetaminophen and children&#x27;s neurodevelopment should be undertaken.

10.7759/cureus.26995	A Systematic Review of the Link Between Autism Spectrum Disorder and Acetaminophen: A Mystery to Resolve.	Khan FY; Kabiraj G; Ahmed MA; Adam M; Mannuru SP; Ramesh V; Shahzad A; Chaduvula P; Khan S	The purpose of this study is to review the published papers investigating maternal acetaminophen (AP) use during pregnancy and its effect on the offspring&#x27;s neurodevelopment, particularly autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Acetaminophen is an over-the-counter analgesic and antipyretic considered safe in pregnancy. Recent studies have found an association between acetaminophen and immune system alterations like asthma and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. We used online databases (PubMed/Medline/PubMed Central, Science Direct, and Google Scholar) to search the studies relevant to our topic. We screened the papers by titles, abstracts, and then full-text availability. The screened articles were checked for eligibility using relevant quality assessment tools for each study design, extracting and analyzing the data. We finalized 30 studies after the screening; 14 were ineligible. Our final selection included 16 high-quality papers - 13 prospective cohort studies, two review articles, and one meta-analysis. We found a wide range of neurodevelopmental outcomes in our data collection. So, we included autism spectrum disorders, intelligent quotient (IQ), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), isolated language, attention and executive function, communication, behavior, and psychomotor development. All studies showed an association between acetaminophen use and listed neurodevelopmental outcomes. Long-term use, increased dose, and frequency were associated with a stronger association. We extracted collective evidence from 16 studies suggesting acetaminophen&#x27;s role in developing adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. It is urgent to do more research on this association before pregnant women can be cautioned about the precise use of acetaminophen.	Cureus	01/07/2022
10.1002/advs.202413170	Multiomics Analyses Reveal an Essential Role of Tryptophan in Treatment of csDMARDs in Rheumatoid Arthritis.	Jian C; Zhu J; Wu J; Zhang Y; Chen J; Wang H; Liu H; Xu K; Huang J; Zhu X; Wei Y; Li S; Wang T; Huang X; Zou Q; Zhang J; Su J; Du X; Lu Y; Zhou T; Zhou Y; Tang M; Li B; Zhou X; Wei Q; Yan Q; Zeng F	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a autoimmune disease characterized by heterogeneity in response to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs). This study aims to elucidate molecular differences in response mechanisms of RA patients to csDMARDs through multiomics approach, with particular focus on the role of tryptophan (Trp) in treatment. Plasma, fecal, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected for metabolomics, microbiomics, transcriptomics, single-cell transcriptomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics analyses. Additionally, in vitro/vivo experiments and controlled clinical trial were conducted to validate the findings. Comprehensive analysis revealed significant alterations in Trp-related metabolic profiles, microbiota composition, and immune cells, indicating the role of Trp in modulating therapeutic response to csDMARDs. In vitro experiments demonstrated that Trp significantly inhibited the proliferation of MH7A and PBMCs while reducing the secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. Furthermore, in vivo studies showed that Trp treatment decreased arthritis scores and histological scores in mice. Clinical data further confirmed that dietary supplementation with Trp significantly improved disease activity scores and alleviated inflammatory in RA patients. This study highlights the crucial regulatory role of Trp in RA therapy, providing novel insights for optimizing clinical treatment strategies for RA.	Adv Sci (Weinh)	23/09/2025
10.1002/advs.202416575	Steroid Receptor Coactivator-1 Drives Tumor-Associated Macrophage Reprogramming by Mediating MMP12 Transcription in Pancreatic Cancer Perineural Invasion.	Cheng K; Liu L; Gong M; Ji Y; Bai C; Guo X; Chen H; Pan J; Zhang Y; Yuan Y	Perineural invasion (PNI) is a hallmark of pancreatic cancer aggressiveness. However, the feasibility of manipulating tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) reprogramming to influence PNI development remains unclear. Methods: Using in vitro (tumor-DRG co-culture) and in vivo (sciatic nerve injection) models coupled with protein identification by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and ChIP-seq, the role of steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) is investigated in TAM reprogramming and PNI. SRC-1 is up-regulated in TAMs and promotes PNI by binding to signal transducer and activator of transcription 1(STAT1) to enhance matrix metallopeptidase 12 (MMP12) transcription. SRC-1 knockdown attenuated M2-like characteristics in TAMs, reduced MMP12 secretion, and suppressed PNI. Importantly, blocking the SRC-1/STAT1/MMP12 axis (using SRC-1-KO TAMs or MMP12 inhibitors) attenuated PNI progression in vivo. SRC-1 reprograms TAMs via STAT1-mediated MMP12 activation to facilitate PNI. Targeting SRC-1 disrupts this axis and presents a novel therapeutic strategy against PNI in pancreatic cancer.

10.1073/pnas.2419888122	Triple checkpoint blockade of PD-1, Tim-3, and Lag-3 enhances adoptive T cell immunotherapy in a mouse model of ovarian cancer.	Alencar GF; Mohamed AO; Burnett MG; Jean SS; Nelson AR; Su Y; Voillet V; Bates BM; Rodgers Suarez M; Ruskin SL; Trieu L; Lam JL; Bekiranov S; Gottardo R; Greenberg PD; Anderson KG	The five-year survival rate for ovarian cancer patients remains below 50%, underscoring the need for innovative therapies. One promising approach involves engineering T cells to specifically target proteins uniquely overexpressed in tumors, thereby controlling tumor growth without toxicity to healthy tissues. Mesothelin (MSLN) contributes to the malignant and invasive phenotype in ovarian cancer and has limited expression in healthy cells, making it a candidate immunotherapy target. Our previous results in a mouse model of ovarian cancer demonstrated that T cells engineered to express a T cell receptor (TCR) targeting MSLN (TCR(MSLN)) mediated therapeutic activity, delaying tumor growth and prolonging mouse survival. However, inhibitory ligands expressed in the tumor microenvironment (TME) interacted with inhibitory receptors on activated T cells, suppressing antitumor function. We hypothesized combining engineered T cells with checkpoint blockade would enhance T cell function and improve therapeutic efficacy, but administration of monospecific antibodies targeting individual inhibitory pathways had no significant impact on T cell efficacy. By contrast, the combination of PD-1, Tim-3, and Lag-3 blockade with engineered T cells significantly improved T cell function and overall animal survival relative to treatment with antibody alone or TCR(MSLN) with singlet or doublet antibody combinations. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed TCR(MSLN) T cells treated with the triplet antibody combination increased expression of genes involved in interferon responses and metabolic function, and reduced expression of genes associated with exhaustion. These results suggest that strategies to disrupt multiple inhibitory pathways simultaneously may be necessary for improved adoptive T cell therapy efficacy in patients.

10.1016/j.intimp.2025.115557	Identification of ferroptosis-related genes as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in sorafenib-resistant HCC via machine learning and experimental validation.	Zhang J; Geng W; Sun H; Chen J; Fan Y; Tan K	Liver cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), remains a significant health burden with poor survival rates due to late diagnosis and limited treatment options. Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, is the standard first-line therapy for advanced HCC, but long-term use often leads to drug resistance. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, has emerged as a crucial target in cancer therapy, showing potential to enhance treatment efficacy and overcome drug resistance. Previous studies have demonstrated that sorafenib triggers ferroptosis in HCC cells and that ferroptosis plays a significant role in the development of sorafenib resistance. However, the intricate interplay between ferroptosis and sorafenib resistance remains poorly understood, hampering the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Our study focuses on the intricate interplay between ferroptosis and sorafenib resistance in HCC. Using the GSE109211 dataset, we identified differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes associated with sorafenib resistance. Notably, these genes stratified sorafenib-resistant HCC patients into distinct subgroups with different drug sensitivities, immune cell infiltrations, and responses to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Through machine learning algorithms, three hub genes (ECH1, SLC25A28 and ULK1) were identified to be closely associated with sorafenib resistance. A novel ferroptosis-related signature comprising these genes emerged as a robust diagnostic model, validated by ROC curve analysis, for predicting sorafenib resistance in HCC patients. Furthermore, experimental validation confirmed the upregulation of ECH1, SLC25A28 and ULK1 expressions in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells, with sorafenib treatment altering their expression profiles. Knockdown of ULK1 in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells potently enhanced sorafenib-induced ferroptosis, thereby alleviating sorafenib resistance. Our findings not only identify pivotal ferroptosis-related genes as diagnostic biomarkers for sorafenib resistance but also provide insights into the role of ferroptosis in modulating sorafenib responsiveness. This study offers a promising strategy to overcome sorafenib resistance and improve patient outcomes in HCC treatment, highlighting the potential of ferroptosis-targeted therapies in cancer management.

Park S; Park H; Byun YG; Wei X; Eom J; Joo J; Lee AJ; Diao Y; Chung WS; Jung I	Astrocytes are critical contributors to brain disorders, yet the mechanisms underlying their selective vulnerability to specific diseases remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that NR3C1 acts as a key regulator of early postnatal astrocyte development, shaping long-term immune responses in mice. Through integrative analyses of gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and long-range chromatin interactions, we identify 55 stage-specific TFs, with NR3C1 uniquely associated with early postnatal maturation. Although mice lacking astrocytic NR3C1 exhibit no detectable developmental abnormalities, these mice display heightened susceptibility to exacerbated immune responses following adult-onset experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Many of the dysregulated EAE response genes are linked to candidate cis-regulatory elements altered by early NR3C1 loss, driving exacerbated inflammatory responses. Notably, only NR3C1 depletion during early, but not late, astrocyte development induces long-lasting epigenetic reprogramming that primes astrocytic immune responses.	Nat Commun	22/09/2025

Using patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), we investigated the biological underpinnings of this heterogeneous response. FOLFIRI-resistant models showed transcriptional upregulation of innate immunity and mitochondrial metabolism genes, together with reduced expression of the DNA polymerase POLD1. Sensitive counterparts exhibited a BRCAness-like phenotype with genomic scars of homologous recombination (HR) deficiency, not caused by genetic or epigenetic loss of HR genes but by low abundance of the RAD51 recombinase. In tumoroids, forced RAD51 overexpression attenuated HR deficiency-related scars and chemotherapy-induced damage, while HR inhibition through ATM blockade enhanced drug sensitivity. The predictive relevance of key response determinants was validated in clinical samples. This work illuminates functional, non-genetic facets of BRCAness in mCRC and introduces actionable biomarkers and targets, offering prospects to improve clinical decision-making and broaden therapeutic options for chemorefractory patients.

10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.107.098475	Effects of candesartan compared with amlodipine in hypertensive patients with high cardiovascular risks: candesartan antihypertensive survival evaluation in Japan trial.	Ogihara T; Nakao K; Fukui T; Fukiyama K; Ueshima K; Oba K; Sato T; Saruta T	The Candesartan Antihypertensive Survival Evaluation in Japan Trial was designed to compare the long-term effects of the angiotensin II receptor blocker candesartan and the calcium channel blocker amlodipine on the incidence of cardiovascular events, represented as a composite of sudden death and cerebrovascular, cardiac, renal, and vascular events in high-risk Japanese hypertensive patients. We conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label study with blinded assessment of the end point in 4728 Japanese hypertensive patients (mean age: 63.8 years; mean body mass index: 24.6 kg/m(2)). Patients were followed for an average of 3.2 years. Blood pressure was well controlled with both treatment-based regimens (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure: 136.1/77.3 mm Hg for candesartan-based regimens and 134.4/76.7 mm Hg for amlodipine-based regimens after 3 years). Primary cardiovascular events occurred in 134 patients with both the candesartan- and amlodipine-based regimens. The 2 treatment-based regimens produced no significant differences in cardiovascular morbidity or mortality in the high-risk Japanese hypertensive patients (hazard ratio: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.28; P=0.969). In each primary end point category, there was no significant difference between the 2 treatment-based regimens. New-onset diabetes occurred in fewer patients taking candesartan (8.7/1000 person-years) than in those taking amlodipine (13.6/1000 person-years), which resulted in a 36% relative risk reduction (hazard ratio: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.43 to 0.97; P=0.033). We disclosed that candesartan-based and amlodipine-based regimens produced no statistical differences in terms of the primary cardiovascular end point, whereas candesartan prevented new-onset diabetes more effectively than amlodipine.

10.1016/j.phymed.2025.157246	Comparison of the efficacy and action mechanism of Chinese patent medicines for liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.	Fu L; Xie J; Wang Z; Jiang T; Zeng Y; Yan J; Sun R; Huang M; Du S; Wang X; Liu Y; Xi K; Chen A; Ma X; Zeng J; Efferth T	BACKGROUND: Liver fibrosis is a critical stage in liver disease progression and can advance to cirrhosis without appropriate treatment. Hepatitis B virus infection is the primary cause of liver fibrosis. Antiviral drugs, e.g., entecavir, are widely used to treat liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Additionally, Chinese patent medicines, such as Biejiajian Pill (BJP), Liuwei Wuling Tablet (LWT), Fufang Biejia Ruangan Tablet (FFT), Fuzheng Huayu Capsule (FZC), and Anluo Huaxian Pill (AHP), demonstrate therapeutic effects. However, there is still insufficient evidence-based agreement on the most effective therapies and how they work. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the most effective Chinese patent medicines for treating liver fibrosis and cirrhosis by combining network meta-analysis and network pharmacology. It also summarises and evaluates the potential mechanisms of effective treatment methods based on published clinical research data. The aim is to provide scientific evidence for clinical decision-making. Finally, these results were verified through experiments. The aim is to provide a scientific basis for clinical decision-making. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of eight databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Weipu Database (VIP), and Wanfang) for studies published up to April 2025. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, clinical outcomes such as Hyaluronic Acid (HA), Laminin (LN), Type IV Collagen (IV-C), Type III Procollagen (PC-III), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), and Total Bilirubin (TBIL) were analyzed. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using network pharmacology, with core genes identified via CytoHubba in CytoScape 3.10.0. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were used to explore the underlying mechanisms. Next, we validated these predictions using in vivo experiments, observing pathological changes through HE Staining, Masson&#x27;s Trichrome Staining, Picro Sirius Red Staining, and Immunohistochemistry, and performing protein expression analysis using Western blotting. RESULTS: A total of 380 studies involving 37,380 patients, were included. Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve (SUCRA) and Rank 1 probability were used to assess the therapeutic efficacy of each prescription. For liver fibrosis, AHP was the most effective, followed by LWT, FZC, BJP, and FFT. In cirrhosis treatment, LWT was the most effective, followed by AHP, FZC, BJP, and FFT. Combined with network pharmacology analyses revealed that AHP and LWT might play a role in liver fibrosis and cirrhosis by regulating targets such as Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3), Matrix Metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), Protein kinase B (AKT1), etc. Animal experiments have shown that Chinese patent medicines such as LWT and AHP can significantly improve liver damage in mice and reduce the levels of Alpha-Smooth Muscle Actin (α-SMA), Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF-β), Fibronectin (FN), STAT3, and MMP9 in the CCL(4) group, while increasing the expression and content of AKT1. CONCLUSION: AHP and LWT are the most effective treatments for liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively according to current network meta-analysis. LWT and AHP may play a role in liver fibrosis and cirrhosis by regulating targets such as STAT3, MMP9, and AKT1, providing a solid foundation for clinical treatment strategies.

10.1002/mgg3.830	Genetics and genetic counseling in psychiatry: Results from an opinion survey of professionals and users.	Martorell L; Sanfeliu A; Blázquez A; Lojo E; Cortés MJ; de Pablo J; Vilella E	BACKGROUND: The heritability of several psychiatric disorders is high, and specific at-risk variants have been identified. Therefore, genetic counseling and genetic testing can be prescribed to some psychiatric patients, but these services are not standardized for most of the population. The aims of the study were to gather opinions from mental health professionals and users regarding (a) the genetics of psychiatric disorders and (b) the usefulness of a genetic counseling unit in psychiatry. METHODS: The survey was conducted in the province of Tarragona (Spain), and we analyzed 152 valid questionnaires from professionals and 959 from users. RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of professionals strongly believed that psychiatric disorders have a genetic basis, and 59% rated a genetic counseling unit in psychiatry as very or extremely useful. However, only a few professionals reported that patients asked them about the genetics of their diseases (12%) or the possibility of transmitting the disease to offspring (19%). Forty-seven percent of users strongly believed that psychiatric disorders have a genetic basis, 30% responded that they talked with their families about the genetics of their diseases, and 43% were worried about transmitting the disease to offspring; however, only 14% reported that their psychiatrist had talked to them about this topic. Remarkably, 80% of users would consider a genetic counseling unit very or extremely useful. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that mental health professionals were more aware of the genetic basis of psychiatric disorders than users, and both considered the implementation of a genetic counseling service very useful.

10.1016/j.lanhl.2025.100761	Bone quality response to lifestyle intervention in older adults with obesity (LIMB-Q trial): a randomised controlled trial.	Gregori G; Mediwala S; Liebschner M; Kim D; Bryant MS; Klonis N; Armamento-Villareal R; Qualls C; Villareal DT	BACKGROUND: Lifestyle interventions for weight loss might exacerbate age-related bone loss and osteoporosis. However, there is limited knowledge about their effects on bone quality. We examined whether lifestyle intervention can preserve or enhance bone quality, despite reductions in bone mineral density. METHODS: The Lifestyle Intervention to Improve Bone Quality (LIMB-Q) study was a randomised controlled trial conducted at Baylor College of Medicine and the Michael E DeBakey VA Medical Center (Houston, TX, USA) including older adults (aged 65-85 years) with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m(2)). Participants were randomly assigned to receive either an intensive lifestyle intervention (intensive lifestyle group, consisting of weight management plus exercise training) or healthy lifestyle (healthy lifestyle group, consisting of educational sessions on healthy diets). The co-primary outcomes were 12-month changes in (1) distal tibia cortical thickness, measured using high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT, and (2) hip bone strength (failure load), assessed via finite element analysis of CT scans. The primary endpoint was analysed by intention to treat (all randomly assigned patients). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03329963 (completed). FINDINGS: Of 138 participants assessed for eligibility in person between Nov 9, 2017, and Nov 8, 2021, 120 were included in this study (mean age 71·4 years [SD 4·6]; 63 [53%] male and 57 [47%] female). At 12 months, weight loss was greater in the intensive lifestyle group than in the healthy lifestyle group (-11·6 kg [SE 0·5] vs -1·2 kg [0·5]). No group differences were noted in the change in distal tibia cortical thickness between the intensive lifestyle group (-0·013 mm [SE 0·026]) and the healthy lifestyle group (-0·002 mm [0·025]; between-group difference 0·027 [95% CI -0·066 to 0·120], p=0·40). The change in hip failure load at 12 months did not differ between the intensive lifestyle group (13 N [SE 25]) and the healthy lifestyle group (3 N [26]; between-group difference -6.9 N [95% CI -108 to 95], p=0·89). Exercise-related adverse events in the intensive lifestyle group included a small number of musculoskeletal events (falls [one participant], neck pain [two], and foot, shoulder, back, and leg pain [one each]). INTERPRETATION: Lifestyle intervention preserved bone quality in older adults with obesity during weight loss. Further research is needed to determine whether lifestyle interventions can reduce fracture risk in older adults with obesity.

10.1038/s41418-025-01589-2	USP2 promotes metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease progression via stabilization of PPARγ.	Luo H; Zhu C; Wang Y; Dai Y; Hao P; Cai H; Bai W; Zhang Z; Wan J; Zhang Y; Sun Y; Zhang Z; Wu Y; Zhai Y; Wu W; Lei H; Xu H; He M; Wu Y	Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis are not fully understood. Here, we identify the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubiquitin-specific protease 2 (USP2) as a key regulator in hepatic lipid metabolism and MASLD progression. We show that USP2 expression is significantly upregulated in liver tissues from MASLD patients and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mouse models. Usp2 knockout or pharmacological inhibition alleviates hepatic steatosis and improves systemic metabolic parameters both in vivo and in vitro. Strikingly, hepatocyte-targeted GalNAc-conjugated siRNA against Usp2 markedly attenuates MASLD in mouse models, highlighting therapeutic potential. Mechanistically, USP2 directly interacts with and stabilizes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) by removing K48-linked ubiquitin chains at lysine 161 within its DNA-binding domain, thereby preventing proteasomal degradation and enhancing its transcriptional activity. This USP2-PPARγ axis promotes hepatic lipid accumulation and drives MASLD progression. Our findings uncover a novel regulatory mechanism in MASLD pathogenesis and suggest that USP2 may represent a promising and druggable therapeutic target for metabolic liver disease.

10.4415/ANN_11_01_17	Rare diseases and orphan drugs.	Taruscio D; Capozzoli F; Frank C	According to the Regulation (EC) N. 141/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council, rare diseases are life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions, affecting no more than 5 in 10 000 persons in the European Community. It is estimated that between 6000 to 8000 distinct rare diseases affect up to 6% of the total EU population. Therefore, these conditions can be considered rare if taken individually but they affect a significant proportion of the European population when considered as a single group. Several initiatives have been undertaken at international, European and national level to tackle public health as well as research issues related to the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and surveillance of these diseases. The development of innovative and effective medical products for their diagnosis and treatment is frequently hampered by several factors, including the limited knowledge of their natural history, the difficulties in setting up clinical studies due to the limited numbers of patients affected by a specific disease, the weak interest of sponsors due to the restricted market opportunities. Therefore, incentives and other facilitations have been adopted in many parts of the world, including in the EU, in order to facilitate the development and commercialization of diagnostic tools and treatments devoted to rare diseases. This paper illustrates mainly the European initiatives and will discuss the problematic and controversial aspects surrounding orphan drugs. Finally, activities and measures adopted in Italy are presented.	Ann Ist Super Sanita	01/01/2011
10.1002/cre2.920	Evaluation of the Effects of Punica granatum Flower Tablets on Pain and Healing of Minor Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis: A Randomized Clinical Trial.	Lavaee F; Parhizkar E; Tavakoli F; Zarshenas MM; Asmarian N	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the therapeutic effect of the Punica granatum (PG) flower on recurrent aphthous stomatitis in comparison with corticosteroid therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-over randomized clinical trial was conducted on the patients who had been referred to Shiraz Dental School for their RAS in 2021. All the participants used both P. granatum flower tablets and Triadent a month apart for wash-out time and all compared themselves. In the experimental group, 30 patients received pomegranate flower tablets, three tablets daily, for 6 days. In the control group, oral paste Triadent has been prescribed three times a day for 6 days. The visual analog scale (VAS) and the size of RAS were evaluated on Days 0-6. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 21. The Wilcoxon test was used. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 27.8 ± 14.77 years old. In this study, 15 patients (50%) were men and 15 patients (50%) were women. The mean value of VAS after using prescribed treatment in both evaluated groups on all days was significantly different such that the VAS values were lower for PG flower tablets than Triadent (p value &lt; 0.05). The size of oral lesions in participants who used PG flower tablets was significantly less than those who used Triadent on all evaluation days (p value &lt; 0.05) except on Day 1 (p value = 0.29). The descending slope of VAS from Days 1 to 6 for both Triadent and PG flower tablet users was significant and noticeable. (p value &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: According to the result of this study, both P. granatum flower tablet and Triadent are useful in reducing the size, period of healing, and VAS of patients with RAS, but the PG flower tablet is more effective.

Zemski Berry K; Garfield A; Whytock KL; Macias E; Zarini S; Jambal P; Stepaniak T; Bowen S; Perreault L; Johnson C; Kahn D; Kerege A; Tamburini IJ; Nguyen CM; Viesi CH; Seldin M; Sun Y; Walsh M; Sparks LM; Bergman BC	Subcellular lipid accumulation and intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) accumulation are associated with insulin resistance, but the impact of combined weight loss and exercise training on localization of lipids and IMAT cellular composition is not known. Twenty-one adults with obesity (18 female and 3 male; 46 ± 2 years; 35.0 ± 0.9 kg/m2) completed a 3-month supervised weight loss and exercise training intervention. Insulin sensitivity was measured using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, and basal and insulin-stimulated vastus lateralis biopsies were collected pre- and postintervention. After the intervention, body weight and body fat decreased (11 ± 1% and 9 ± 1%, respectively), while VO2 peak and insulin sensitivity increased (14 ± 3% and 68 ± 14%, respectively). Lipidomics revealed reduced sarcolemmal and nuclear triglycerides, with unchanged whole-muscle triglycerides. Whole-muscle diacylglycerols increased because of increased nuclear 1,2-diacylglycerols without PKCε, PKCθ, or PKCδ activation. Whole-muscle sphingolipid levels increased because of cytosolic accumulation. Single-nuclei RNA sequencing showed altered IMAT cellular composition, including increased fibro-adipogenic progenitors, vascular cells, and macrophages, and decreased preadipocytes. Bulk muscle RNA sequencing indicated upregulation of genes related to muscle remodeling and cellular respiration, and there were changes in the relationship between nuclear diacylglycerols and gene expression postintervention. These findings dissociate improvements in insulin sensitivity from total muscle diacylglycerol and sphingolipid levels and highlight roles for subcellular lipid redistribution and IMAT remodeling in insulin sensitization. ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS: Evaluation of subcellular fractionated muscle revealed decreases in sarcolemmal and nuclear triglycerides and increases in nuclear diacylglycerols and cytosolic sphingolipids postintervention. Weight loss revealed alteration in the cellular composition of intermuscular adipose tissue and upregulation of genes related to muscle remodeling and cellular respiration. These findings dissociate improvements in insulin sensitivity from total muscle 1,2-diacylglycerol and sphingolipid levels and highlight roles of intermuscular adipose tissue remodeling for enhanced insulin sensitivity.

10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01206-1	Oncolytic viruses as anticancer agents: clinical progress and remaining challenges.	Appleton E; Chiocca EA; Ungerechts G; Melcher A; Vile R	Immunotherapy has transformed the treatment of cancer, yet many patients do not have response or lasting benefit. Strategies to overcome resistance remain of crucial importance. Oncolytic viruses offer a promising approach, with the unique ability to selectively replicate within (and to destroy) cancer cells, remodel the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment, and stimulate antitumour immunity. Interest in the potential of oncolytic viruses has grown steadily over the past two decades, fuelled by advances in cancer immunology and viral engineering. However, clinical translation has not kept pace, and although a plethora of promising new constructs have entered clinical testing, several barriers continue to restrict widespread clinical implementation. This Therapeutics paper highlights key milestones in oncolytic virus clinical development, discusses the challenges that remain, and, through clinical reflection, considers how future research might be streamlined to achieve meaningful benefit for patients.

10.2460/ajvr.67.10.1681	Pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin and concentrations in body fluids and bronchoalveolar cells of foals.	Womble AY; Giguère S; Lee EA; Vickroy TW	OBJECTIVE: To determine pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin and concentrations in body fluids and bronchoalveolar (BAL) cells of foals. ANIMALS: 6 healthy 2-to 3-week-old foals. PROCEDURES: In a crossover design, clarithromycin (7.5 mg/kg) was administered to each foal via IV and intragastric (IG) routes. After the initial IG administration, 5 additional doses were administered IG at 12-hour intervals. Concentrations of clarithromycin and its 14-hydroxy metabolite were measured in serum by use of high-performance liquid chromatography. A microbiologic assay was used to measure clarithromycin activity in serum, urine, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, CSF, pulmonary epithelial lining fluid (PELF), and BAL cells. RESULTS: After IV administration, elimination half-life (5.4 hours) and mean +/- SD body clearance (1.27 +/- 0.25 L/h/kg) and apparent volume of distribution at steady state (10.4 +/- 2.1 L/kg) were determined for clarithromycin. The metabolite was detected in all 6 foals by 1 hour after clarithromycin administration. Oral bioavailability of clarithromycin was 57.3 +/- 12.0%. Maximum serum concentration of clarithromycin after multiple IG administrations was 0.88 +/- 0.19 microg/mL. After IG administration of multiple doses, clarithromycin concentrations in peritoneal fluid, CSF, and synovial fluid were similar to or lower than concentrations in serum, whereas concentrations in urine, PELF, and BAL cells were significantly higher than concentrations in serum. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Oral administration of clarithromycin at 7.5 mg/kg every 12 hours maintains concentrations in serum, PELF, and BAL cells that are higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration (0.12 microg/mL) for Rhodococcus equiisolates for the entire 12-hour dosing interval.

10.1038/s41418-025-01582-9	TRIM24-mediated K27-linked ubiquitination of ULK1 alleviates energy stress-induced autophagy and promote prostate cancer growth in the context of SPOP mutation.	Chen S; Lin J; Yang Z; Wang Y; Wang Q; Wang D; Qu Y; Lin Q; Liu J; Yan S; Wang Z; Qian X; Xiao Y; Li X; Chen Y; Fang W; Zhao J; Lu Z; Ren H; Zhu Y; Ma L	SPOP, the most frequently mutated gene in prostate cancer, has been implicated in the aberrant activation of stress granules, presenting significant challenges in disease management. However, the mechanistic link between SPOP mutations and cellular energy stress remains inadequately explored. In this study, we demonstrate that ULK1 expression is positively correlated with both loss-of-function mutations in SPOP and the upregulation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM24 in human prostate cancer specimens. Mechanistically, SPOP mutations induce the upregulation of TRIM24, which subsequently binds to ULK1 and catalyzes its non-degradative K27-linked polyubiquitylation. This post-translational modification enhances the stability of ULK1, facilitating cellular adaptation to energy stress and consequently promoting prostate cancer progression. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of TRIM24 using TRIM24-PROTAC (proteolysis-targeting chimera) effectively suppressed tumor growth in mice bearing SPOP-mutant prostate cancer cells. Collectively, these findings elucidate a pivotal role of SPOP mutations in modulating energy stress responses via TRIM24-mediated ULK1 ubiquitylation and underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting TRIM24 in SPOP-mutant prostate cancers.

10.1021/acsnano.5c06003	Hydrogel Loaded with Aminoethyl Anisamide-Modified Exosomes Attenuates Hepatic Fibrosis by Targeting Activated Hepatic Stellate Cells.	Sun Z; Zheng Q; Zhang Y; Bai C; Wang F; Yang P; Zhu D; Liu X; Li S; Liu D; Li R; He L; Yao J; Li X	Stem cell-based regenerative research has highlighted the therapeutic potential of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (hucMSC-Exos) for hepatic tissue regeneration and repair. However, exosomes undergo rapid clearance following systemic administration, limiting their therapeutic potential because of insufficient retention and sustained release. In this study, an innovative hydrogel-mediated delivery platform encapsulating aminoethyl anisamide (AEAA)-functionalized exosomes was developed to mitigate hepatic fibrosis. By synthesizing a hydrogel (CMC-OD/TA-Fe(III), Gel) composed of carboxymethyl chitosan, oxidized dextran, and iron tannate, and then encapsulating umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes functionalized by AEAA (AEAA-Exos), we implanted this Gel/AEAA-Exos into mice with hepatic fibrosis by intraperitoneal injection to evaluate the therapeutic effect of the hydrogel. The hydrogel had favorable physical properties, optimal biocompatibility, and a sustained-release profile. And Gel/AEAA-Exos system significantly reduced oxidative stress and alleviated hepatic fibrosis. Additionally, RNA-seq revealed that the Gel/AEAA-Exos system ameliorates hepatic fibrogenesis mainly by modulating oxidative stress, collagen deposition, and inflammatory cascade in liver tissues. This strategy offers a targeted and efficient approach for treating liver fibrosis induced by chronic hepatic injury and improves targeting efficiency and therapeutic outcomes through engineered exosome delivery.

10.1172/JCI194080	Allergen-Specific mRNA-Lipid Nanoparticle Therapy for Prevention and Treatment of Experimental Allergy in Mice.	Rochman Y; Kotliar M; Klingler AM; Rochman M; Alameh MG; Melamed JR; Osswald GA; Caldwell JM; Felton JM; Mack LE; Hargis J; Lewkowich IP; Barski A; Weissman D; Rothenberg ME	Allergic diseases have reached epidemic proportions globally, calling attention to the need for better treatment and preventive approaches. Herein, we developed allergen-encoding messenger RNA (mRNA) lipid nanoparticle (LNP) strategies for both therapy and prevention of allergic responses. Immunization with allergen-encoded mRNA-LNPs modulated T cell differentiation, inhibiting the generation of T helper type 2 (Th2) and type 17 (Th17) cells upon allergen exposure in experimental asthma models induced by ovalbumin (OVA), and naturally occurring house dust mite (HDM) and the major HDM allergen Der p1. Allergen-specific mRNA-LNP treatment attenuated clinicopathology in both preventive and established allergy models, including reduction in eosinophilia, mucus production, and airway hypersensitivity, while enhancing production of allergen-specific IgG antibodies and maintaining low IgE levels. Additionally, allergen-specific mRNA-LNP vaccines in mice elicited a CD8+CD38+KLRG- T cell response as seen following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in human, underscoring a conserved immune mechanism across species, regardless of the mRNA-encoded protein. Notably, mRNA-LNP vaccination in combination with an mTOR inhibitor reduced the CD8+ T cell response without affecting the vaccine-induced anti-allergic effect in the preventive model of asthma. This technology renders allergen-specific mRNA-LNP therapy as a promising approach for prevention and treatment of allergic diseases.	J Clin Invest	23/09/2025
10.1186/s13567-023-01248-9	Streptococcus ruminantium-associated sheep mastitis outbreak detected in Italy is distinct from bovine isolates.	Rosa MN; Vezina B; Marogna G; Canu A; Molotzu MR; Tola S	Streptococcus ruminantium is the causative agent of several bovine and ovine diseases, however reports are uncommon and application of whole genome sequencing to identify is rare. We report for the first time, a severe ovine mastitis outbreak caused by S. ruminantium in Italy, 2022. S. ruminantium was isolated from 12 adult lactating ewes with diffuse nodules in the mammary parenchyma and predominantly serous and clotted milk. All outbreak isolates, along with five additional historical Italian isolates (between 2011 and 2017), were genomically characterised and then analysed in the context of all publicly available S. ruminantium genomes. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed to determine the MICs of 16 antibiotics. The results showed that all isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested except kanamycin. Single Nucleotide Variant analysis confirmed this as a clonal outbreak across 10 sheep (≤ 15 SNVs), while the two others were colonised by more distantly related clones (≤ 53 pairwise SNVs), indicating the presence of multiple infecting lineages. The five historical S. ruminantium isolates were comprised of genetically-distant singletons (between 1259 and 5430 pairwise SNVs to 2022 outbreak isolates). Ovine isolates were found to be genetically distinct to bovine isolates, forming monophyletic groups. Bovine isolates were similarly made up of singleton clones in all but two isolates. Taken together, our genomic analysis using all globally available genomes is consistent with general opportunistic pathogenesis of S. ruminantium. We encourage future genomic surveillance efforts to facilitate outbreak detection, as well as improve our understanding of this poorly-understood, multi-host, zoonotic pathogen.	Vet Res	12/12/2023
10.1073/pnas.2503966122	Inorganic sulfate is critical for Mycobacterium tuberculosis lung tissue colonization and redox balance.	Le Mouëllic W; Levillain F; Wu TD; Caouaille M; Bousso P; Poquet Y; Neyrolles O	Tuberculosis remains the deadliest infectious disease caused by a single pathogen, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapies. A deeper understanding of Mycobacterium tuberculosis metabolism could uncover specific vulnerabilities and inform the development of new treatments. Sulfur, essential for bacterial growth and survival, fuels key pathways including redox buffering and coenzyme production. Although previous studies suggest that M. tuberculosis utilizes various substrates to meet its sulfur requirements, the primary sources of sulfur exploited during in vivo infection remain unclear. Here, we reveal that M. tuberculosis acquires inorganic sulfate through the SubI-CysTWA transporter during macrophage infection. Using nanoSIMS (high spatial resolution Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry) analysis, we observed significant sulfate-derived (33)S enrichment in intracellular bacteria, correlating with metabolic activity. Deletion of subI abolished sulfate uptake, impairing bacterial growth in vitro and reducing M. tuberculosis survival in murine macrophages and lungs of infected mice. Finally, our data demonstrate that sulfate acquisition is essential for maintaining mycobacterial redox balance and resisting nitrosative stress in vitro and in vivo. Thus, unlike many intracellular pathogens, M. tuberculosis depends on an energetically costly inorganic sulfate assimilation pathway to survive in the nutrient-limited host environment. These findings challenge prior assumptions that organic reduced sulfur sources, such as methionine, fuel M. tuberculosis sulfur metabolism during infection. Since animal cells lack a sulfate assimilation pathway, uncovering the critical role of SubI-CysTWA-mediated sulfate import in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis highlights this pathway as a promising pathogen-specific therapeutic target. Targeting this system could either directly impair M. tuberculosis survival during infection or sensitize bacilli to antibiotic-induced oxidative stress by disrupting redox homeostasis.

10.1038/s42255-025-01354-2	Slc7a7 licenses macrophage glutaminolysis for restorative functions in atherosclerosis.

Atherosclerotic plaque macrophages are key players at the site of disease, where metabolic reprogramming dictates the progression of pathogenesis. Here we show that reduced macrophage glutaminase activity is related to glutaminase (GLS)-1 and not GLS2 expression. While glutamine synthetase serves as a metabolic rheostat controlling nutrient flux into cells in vitro, macrophage restorative functions in the context of atherosclerosis relies more heavily on glutamine influx. Enhanced glutamine flux is largely mediated by the SLC7A7 exchanger in macrophages: Slc7a7-silenced macrophages have reduced glutamine influx and GLS1-dependent glutaminolysis, impeding downstream signalling involved in macrophage restorative functions. In vivo, macrophage-specific deletion of Slc7a7 accelerates atherosclerosis in mice with more complex necrotic core composition. Finally, cell-intrinsic regulation of glutaminolysis drives macrophage metabolic and transcriptional rewiring in atherosclerosis by diverting exogenous Gln flux to balance remodelling and restorative functions. Thus, we uncover a role of SLC7A7-dependent glutamine uptake upstream of glutaminolysis in atherosclerotic plaque development and stability.	Nat Metab	01/09/2025
10.2174/011570159X417328250908080404	Unraveling the Role of Perivascular Macrophages in Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease: Insights from the Crosstalk between Immunometabolism and Ferroptosis.	Miao X; Yue W; Wang J; Chen J; Qiu L; Paerhati H; Zhou Q; Li P; Wu A; Zhang M	INTRODUCTION: Recent evidence increasingly supports a potential role of Perivascular Macrophages (PVMs), a unique subpopulation of brain immune cells, in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD). Strategically positioned at the brain-vasculature interface, PVMs sense the redox status, modulate immunity, and potentially influence ferroptosis-an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death increasingly implicated in AD. However, whether the involvement of PVMs in AD pathology specifically entails mechanisms related to the crosstalk between immunometabolism and ferroptosis, and the precise molecular pathways linking PVMs, immunometabolism, and ferroptosis to AD, remains unclear. METHODS: We first obtained single-cell RNA sequencing data of PVMs from AD patients and control subjects via the GEO database, identified Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs), and applied Mendelian Randomization (MR), with robustness validated via leave-one-out analysis to pinpoint key genes among the DEGs with causal relevance to AD. Next, we identified ferroptosis-related genes within these key genes and examined their associations with immune cell infiltration and immunometabolic signaling pathways, while also predicting their regulatory transcription factors to inform potential therapeutic strategies. RESULTS: We identified 149 DEGs in PVMs between AD and control groups, which were primarily enriched in immune and metabolic pathways. MR analysis established eight genes (ACSL1, SPATA6, RAB31, NIBAN1, HDAC4, GRAMD1B, GCC2, and DENND3) as causally and negatively associated with AD risk (IVW analysis identified all P &lt; 0.05, with robustness confirmed by leave-one-out analysis), with ACSL1 being recognized as a known ferroptosis driver. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed significant differences in monocyte and neutrophil proportions in AD, with DENND3 identified as the sole gene significantly correlated with monocyte abundance. The Key genes demonstrated distinct associations with immunometabolic pathways: GRAMD1B expression was positively associated with PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, whereas both NIBAN1 and SPATA6 showed enrichment in cells with high Notch signaling activity. ACSL1 exhibited robust associations with multiple pathways implicated in ferroptosis, including the IL-6/JAK/STAT3, interferon-γ, TGF-β, bile acid metabolism, and cholesterol homeostasis pathways, suggesting potential mechanisms that mediate the crosstalk between immunometabolism and ferroptosis. Transcription factor analysis highlighted shared regulation by CEBPD and the SP1/2/3/4 family, indicating convergent transcriptional control of these genes. CONCLUSION: This study identifies eight key genes in PVMs that may protect against AD through mechanisms involving the interplay between immunometabolism and ferroptosis. Our findings provide novel insights into the function of PVMs in AD pathophysiology and suggest potential therapeutic targets for this devastating neurodegenerative disease.

10.1093/aje/kwaa257	Behavioral Problems at Age 11 Years After Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Acetaminophen: Parent-Reported and Self-Reported Outcomes.	Inoue K; Ritz B; Ernst A; Tseng WL; Yuan Y; Meng Q; Ramlau-Hansen CH; Strandberg-Larsen K; Arah OA; Obel C; Li J; Olsen J; Liew Z	Several studies have reported associations between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and behavioral outcomes in young children. We aimed to evaluate the associations of prenatal and postnatal exposures to acetaminophen with behavioral problems in children at age 11 years, using behavioral measures reported by parents and children. We studied 40,934 mother-child pairs from the Danish National Birth Cohort enrolled during 1996-2002. Parent-reported and child-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) responses were collected during the 11-year follow-up. We estimated risk ratios for behavioral problems including total difficulties as well as internalizing or externalizing behaviors following prenatal (during pregnancy) or postnatal (within the first 18 months after birth) acetaminophen exposure. Parent-reported and child-reported SDQ scores were moderately correlated; higher for externalizing (r = 0.59) than internalizing (r = 0.49) behaviors. Prenatal acetaminophen exposure was associated with 10%-40% higher risks for total difficulties and internalizing and externalizing problems based on parent- or child-reported SDQ, with the association being stronger for greater cumulative weeks of acetaminophen use. Postnatal exposure was associated with 16%-19% higher risks for parent-reported internalizing behaviors, but the associations were weak or null for child-reported scores except for prosocial behavior. Our study corroborates published associations between prenatal exposures to acetaminophen and behavioral problems and extends the literature to early adolescence.	Am J Epidemiol	01/06/2021
10.1126/scitranslmed.adt9100	USP5 inhibition enables potential therapy for t(8;21) AML through ubiquitin-mediated AML1-ETO degradation in patient-derived xenografts.	Ma L; Zhang K; Zhang Z; Wang C; Ma M; Liu Y; Zhao Y; Gong Z; Liu N; Wei M; Liu X; Zhou J; Liu S; Yang C; Yang G	The AML1-ETO (AE) fusion protein is a key target for treating t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this investigation, we identified ubiquitin-specific protease 5 (USP5) as the deubiquitinating enzyme of AE. USP5 knockdown decreased AML cell growth and induced differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we developed a high-throughput screening (HTS) method and identified a potent, selective USP5 inhibitor, WCY-8-67. This lead compound was identified as a selective USP5 inhibitor by targeting the ubiquitin-associated domain 2 (UBA2) region. It also induced aggregation and precipitation of the target protein, which led to USP5 dysfunction. WCY-8-67 exhibited excellent in vivo bioavailability and tolerability, and it effectively inhibited the growth of AML cells in animal models. In addition, in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model, this compound, when combined with 5-azacytidine (5-Aza), improved therapeutic effects. This study presents promising targeted therapeutic possibilities for the treatment of t(8;21) AML that require further study.	Sci Transl Med	24/09/2025
10.1097/JS9.0000000000003527	Associations between dietary intake and pancreatic disease: a mendelian randomization study.	Zhang Q; Yu S; Gao D; Gong J	BACKGROUND: Pancreatic diseases, including acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer, pose significant health challenges. The role of diet in these diseases is not well understood due to confounding factors in observational studies. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to clarify the causal relationships between dietary intake and pancreatic diseases using Mendelian randomization (MR). METHODS: A two-sample MR approach was employed, utilizing genetic data from the UK Biobank for dietary exposures and the FinnGen consortium for pancreatic disease outcomes. Genetic variants were selected as instrumental variables (IVs) to assess the impact of 26 dietary components on acute and chronic pancreatitis, as well as pancreatic cancer. Meta-analyses were performed to validate findings across datasets, and multivariable MR (MVMR) analyses assessed the independent effects of dietary factors. RESULTS: The analysis revealed that dried fruit intake was protective against both acute (OR = 0.396, p = 0.028) and chronic pancreatitis (OR = 0.289, p &lt; 0.001). Conversely, red wine (OR = 1.559, p = 0.039) and bread (OR = 2.244, p = 0.044) were linked to increased acute pancreatitis risk. Pork was associated with chronic pancreatitis (OR = 3.652, p = 0.048), while oily fish intake correlated with a higher risk of pancreatic cancer (OR = 1.699, p = 0.046). Meta-analyses confirmed dried fruit protective association with acute pancreatitis. MVMR analyses indicated independent causal relationships between dried fruit and both acute and chronic pancreatitis. CONCLUSION: This study showed the protective effects of dried fruit and salad/raw vegetables against pancreatic diseases, while red wine, bread, and pork may elevate risk. Dietary modifications could serve as effective preventive strategies, warranting further exploration of underlying mechanisms.	Int J Surg	24/09/2025
